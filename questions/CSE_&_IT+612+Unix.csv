Question 1,1. What is UNIX?,a) an operating system,b) a text editor,c) programming language,d) software program,a,"Explanation: UNIX is an operating system developed in the early 1970’s at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, and others. It is a multiuser, multitasking and timesharing operating system. The power of UNIX is derived from its commands and their multiple options.  "
Question 2,2. In which language UNIX is written?,a) JAVA,b) Python,c) C++,d) C,d,"Explanation: UNIX was originally written in Assembly language but Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson wanted an operating system which could run on more than one type of hardware. So in 1973, they rewrote the whole operating system in C language due to which one of the strongest features i.e. portability was added to the operating system. "
Question 3,3. Which of the following is not a feature of UNIX?,a) multitasking,b) multiuser,c) portability,d) easy to use,d,"Explanation: UNIX is a multitasking operating system i.e.  a user can run multiple tasks concurrently. Similarly, it is a multiuser system because it permits working with multiple users on a single operating system. But a major disadvantage of UNIX lies in the fact that the richness provided by its commands requires a special type of commitment to understand the subject. i.e. the user must be well aware of commands he is using and the functions performed by them. "
Question 4,4.  Which of the following is not a part of all the versions of UNIX?, a) Kernel and Shell, b) Commands and utilities, c) Graphical user interface, d) System Calls,c,"Explanation: The kernel is the heart of the operating system while the shell is the utility which processes our requests. While system calls are a handful of functions which are used to interact with the kernel and make available the services provided by the operating system. A Graphical user interface (GUI) is available in UNIX, but the traditional UNIX interface is the command line only. "
Question 5,5. Which of the following is not true about UNIX?,a) Many people can use a UNIX based computer at the same time; hence UNIX is called as a multiuser system, b) A user can run multiple programs at the same time; hence UNIX is called a multitasking environment., c) UNIX was not written in ‘C’ language, d) Linux is also known as a version of UNIX,c,"Explanation: One of the most attractive features of UNIX is that it supports multi-user and multitasking environment which makes it so popular among its users. There are many UNIX variants available in the market. Solaris Unix, AIX, HP Unix, BSD are some of the examples. Linux is also a flavor of UNIX which is freely available. Unix was developed in 1969 by AT&T employees Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna at Bell Labs and was written in ‘C’. "
Question 6,"6.  POSIX is a set of standards specified for establishing compatibility between operating systems.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: POSIX- Portable Operating System Interface for Computer Environment is basically a set of standards specified by IEEE for establishing compatibility between operating systems, especially which are UNIX based. For example, if we write a program relying on POSIX standards, we can easily port it among a large family of Unix derivatives (including Linux). "
Question 7,"7. Shell is a command interpreter used for interacting with a UNIX system.a.) Trueb.) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: Computers don’t have any capability of translating commands into actions. To do so we require shell—a command interpreter which translates our commands into actions. It is actually the interface between the user and kernel. There could be multiple shells in action on a single system. 
Question 8,8.  Which part of the UNIX operating system interacts with the hardware?,a) Kernel,b) Shell,c) vi editor,d) application program,a,"Explanation: The kernel is the core of the operating system. It is a collection of routines written in C which directly communicates with the hardware. User programs that need to interact with the hardware access the services of the kernel. There is only one kernel running on a system, unlike shells which can be multiple. "
Question 9,"9. Two UNIX systems may or may not use the same set of system calls.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: All UNIX flavors have one thing in common, they use the same system calls which are described in POSIX specification. "
Question 10,10. What is a superuser?,a) system manager,b) normal user,c) administrator,d) a user with special rights.,a,"Explanation: A superuser (root) is the UNIX system manager which can perform special tasks like killing any executing program, resetting other users passwords, change users permissions and performing other system management tasks. The administrator can switch to superuser by issuing su command. "
Question 11,11. What is the windowing system of UNIX known as?,a) X Window system,b) LINUX,c) Red Hat,d) DOS,a,"Explanation: The X window system, commonly known as X, is a windowing system developed at MIT. It is an open-source, network transparent, client-server based system that provides a Graphical user interface. X is primarily used on UNIX variants but it is also available for other operating systems also. "
Question 12,1. What are Commands?,a) specific instructions for performing a particular task,b) part of the operating system,c) part of the shell,d) special instructions,a,"Explanation: Commands are basically specific instructions which are given by the users to perform a particular piece of a task. In UNIX, commands are entered by the user through a command line interface which further is processed by the command interpreter i.e. Shell."
Question 13,"2. In how many categories, commands of UNIX operating system classified?",a) 1,b) 2,c) Many,d) 0,b,"Explanation: There are two broad categories in which the classification of commands is based on UNIX. They are namely—external commands and internal commands. External commands are those commands that have an independent existence in the /bin directory i.e. these are the executables which are present in separate files while Internal commands are built-in commands which are built into the shell. Example, ‘ls’ is an external command while ‘echo’ is an internal command."
Question 14,3. Which command is used for extracting the details of the operating system?,a) cd,b) echo,c) uname,d) wc,c,"Explanation: uname command is used for extracting the details like name, version of the operating system running on the machine. the cd command is used for changing directories and echo command is used for displaying the contents of a string on to the output stream. wc command is used for counting words and other details in a file.  "
Question 15,"4. The sequences of directories that a shell searches while looking for a command is specified in the PATH variable.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: When we specify a command, the shell searches for that command in the list of directories specified in the PATH variable and then executes it after locating the command successfully."
Question 16,"5. Options are also arguments but begin with a  –  .a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Arguments are parameters which are specified along with commands so that the command can perform an operation or take input from that parameter while options are also arguments but they are predetermined i.e. they perform a particular task. For example, echo hello. In this command hello is an argument while in ls  – l, -l is an option."
Question 17,6. Which of the following is not a valid option of uname?,a) –a,b) –s,c) –v,d) –z,d,"Explanation: uname command is used for printing the information about the current system.  –a is used for printing all the information including version name, kernel name, kernel release, machine hardware name etc. –s is used for printing only the kernel name while –v is used for printing the kernel version."
Question 18,7. How can we specify more than one command in the command line at the same time?,a) using ;,b) using >,c) using ==,d) not possible,a,"Explanation: UNIX allows us to specify more than one command at the same time in the command line. To do so, we have to separate each command from each other using (;). For example, wc file1 ;     ls  -l file1 . The > symbol allows us to redirects the output of the command(s). For example, wc file1 > file2. Now, file2 will contain the output produced by the wc file1 command. Both ; and > are called metacharacters."
Question 19,8. Which command is used to display the documentation of commands in UNIX?,a) help,b) search,c) whatis,d) man,d,"Explanation: UNIX provides us with a facility of man command, which is used for getting documentation of any command. For example, to seek help on wc command simply type man wc. This will simply display all the possible operations, options, description, synopsis of wc command. The POSIX specification requires only one available option with man command i.e.  -k, which prints a one-line description of the command. whatis command is also available on many UNIX systems which also displays a one-line description of the command. man –f emulates the behavior of whatis command."
Question 20,9. Which command is used for displaying date and calendar in UNIX?,a) date and cal,b) DATE and CAL,c) date and calendar,d) dt and cl,a,Explanation: date command is used for displaying the current system date and time while cal command is used to see the calendar of any specific month/year.

Question 23,12. Which command is used for displaying date in the format dd/mm/yyyy ?,a) date  +%m,b) date +%h,c) date  +“%d/%m/%Y”,d) date +“%h %m”,c,"Explanation: Date command can use format specifiers as arguments with each specifiers preceding with a + , followed by % operator and a single character for describing the format.	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('Sanfoundry_300x250_320x50_BTF_1'); });	$ date +%m         -display current month$ date +%h          -display the name of the month$ date +“%h %m”  -display both month and month name "
Question 25,1. echo command is used for _________,a) displaying errors,b) displaying operating system details,c) displaying diagnostic messages,d) displaying date and time,c,"Explanation: echo command is generally used for displaying diagnostic messages on to the terminal or to issue prompt for reading the user input. All shells now have echo built in i.e. it is an internal command.	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist1'); });	$ echo hellohello "
Question 26, ,,,,,,
Question 27,2. What are escape sequences?,a) special characters beginning with a \ (backslash),b) special commands,c) special utilities,d) a sequence of characters,a,"Explanation: An escape sequence is generally a two character string which begins with a \ . The role of escape sequences is that they changes the state of computer or the peripheral devices attached to it, For example, \n is an escape sequence which implies  a new line character."
Question 28,3. Which of the following is not a valid escape sequence in UNIX?,a) \n,b) \t,c) \v,d) \d,d,"Explanation:\n denotes a new line character\t denotes a space tab while \v denotes a vertical tab."
Question 29,4. Which command is used as an alternative to echo command?,a) ls,b) printf,c) wc,d) ps,b,Explanation: printf command is available on most UNIX systems and it behaves much like substitution for echo command. It supports many of the formats which are used by C’s printf function. printf is also an external command. 
Question 30,5. For what purpose bc command is used?,a) as a calculator,b) as a editor,c) as a process table viewer,d) for copying files,a,"Explanation: bc command is used for invoking calculator on UNIX system.

Question 31,6. script command is used for___________,a) recording history,b) recording our session,c) recording passwords,d) recording scripts,b,"Explanation: script command is basically used for recording our login session in a file. All the keystrokes, output, error messages that are encountered while our session will be stored in a file which we can view later. The name of the file in which the session is stored is typescript."
Question 32,7. Which of the following is a valid option with script command?,a) –b,b) –a,c) –d,d) –x,b,"Explanation: script command overwrites any previous typescript that may exist. -a option allows us to append our session to the existing typescript file without overwriting to it. For example,  script  -a We can also record our session to a different log file by using the following command.script   file_one "
Question 34,"8. mailx command is used for sending and receiving emails.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Since UNIX is a multiuser system, so communication between systems seems to be natural and important. For this purpose mailx command is used. Through mailx command we can send and receive mails to different users on same host network or different network. The addressing scheme uses a combination of username and machine name. For example,mailx  bob  (bob is on same host)mailx  [email protected]  (bob is on networked host saturn) "

Question 45,"4. We can use man command for displaying the documentation of man itself.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Since man is also a UNIX command, it is necessary to know how man itself is used. For this purpose, use the same command to view its own documentation:$ man man	// viewing man pages with man "
Question 47,"5. When backspace doesn’t work to erase characters, we can use _____",a) ctrl-f,b) ctrl-h,c) ctrl-c,d) ctrl-u,b,"Explanation: Sometimes it may happen that backspace doesn’t work and whenever it is pressed, ^H is displayed on the terminal. To resolve this problem, we can use control key i.e. ctrl-H. Ctrl-u is used for killing a line altogether without executing it and Ctrl-c interrupts the program and bring back the prompt."
Question 48,"6. For interrupting a command, we can use _____",a) ctrl-f,b) esc,c) ctrl-h,d) ctrl-c,d,"Explanation: Sometimes, a program goes on running on for an hour and does not seem to complete. To interrupt that command we can use the control key, ctrl-c. Ctrl-h is used to erase character by character when backspace doesn’t work."
Question 49,7. Ctrl-S stops scrolling of screen output and ________,a) locks terminal,b) delete a character,c) locks keyboard,d) delete a line,c,Explanation: There are various keyboard commands to try when things go wrong. One of these commands is Ctrl-s which stops scrolling of screen output and locks the keyboard.
Question 50,8. Which control unlocks the keyboard?,a) ctrl-u,b) ctrl-c,c) ctrl-z,d) ctrl-q,d,Explanation: ctrl-q  resumes the scrolling of screen output and unlocks the keyboard. Ctrl-h is used to erase character by character when backspace doesn’t work while and Ctrl-c interrupts the program and bring back the prompt. 
Question 51,9. Which command is used for killing a line?,a) ctrl-k,b) del,c) esc,d) ctrl-u,d,"Explanation: If the command line contains too many mistakes, we could prefer to kill the line altogether without executing it using ctrl-u. It erases everything in the line and returns the cursor to the beginning of the line. "
Question 52,"1.  A file is a container for storing information.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: We can define a file as a stream of characters or a container for storing information. While working in a UNIX environment, we came across three categories of files which are classified as- ordinary file, directory file and device file."
Question 53,"2. In how many broad categories, files are divided in UNIX?",a) 2,b) 4,c) 5,d) 3,d,"Explanation: Files are divided into three major categories i.e. ordinary file, directory file and device file. The characteristics of these three categories of files differ from each other and each category has a predefined use."
Question 54,"3.  In UNIX, the file name and file size are stored in the file itself.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: A UNIX file’s size is not stored in the file, nor its name. All this information is stored separately in a separate area of hard disk which is not directly accessible to humans, but only to the kernel."
Question 55,4.  The most common file type is ___,a) ordinary file,b) directory file,c) device file,d) ordinary file and directory file,a,"Explanation: The most common file type is an ordinary file or a regular file. It contains data as a stream of characters. Ordinary files are also of two types, text file and binary file."
Question 56,5. What is a directory file?,a) a directory containing data,b) a directory containing details of the files and subdirectories it contains,c) a directory contains files,d) a directory containing data and files,b,Explanation: A directory file contains no data but some details of the subdirectories and files that it contains.

Question 57,6. Each entry of directory file has component(s) namely _____,a) filename,b) inode number,c) filename and inode number,d) file size,c,"Explanation: Every entry of the directory file contains information about files and subdirectories and each entry has two components:•    Filename•    A unique identification number (called inode number). "
Question 58,"7. Device files are used by the kernel for operating the device.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: Device files are nothing but special files which does not contain a stream of characters but some attributes related to the devices which govern the operation of a device. The kernel reads this file for the attributes to perform operations on any device.
Question 59,"8.  When we log in, the UNIX places us in a directory, called ______ directory",a) home,b) main,c) parent,d) current,a,"Explanation: When we log in, the system automatically places us in a directory called Home directory.

Question 60,"9.  UNIX treats everything as a file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: All physical devices such as printers, hard disk are treated as files by the UNIX system. Even the kernel, shell and main memory is treated as a file by UNIX operating system."
Question 61,10.  The root directory is represented by ___,a)  \,b)  /,c) *,d) $,b,"Explanation: The root directory (/)  serves as a reference point for all the files. All the files are hierarchically blow it. All files in UNIX are related to one another. The file system in UNIX is a collection of all these related files (ordinary, directory and device files) organized in a hierarchical manner."
Question 62,"11. UNIX imposes no rule for framing filename extensions.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: UNIX imposes no rules for framing filename extensions. For example, a shell script doesn’t need to have the .sh implication, even though it helps in identification. In all cases, it’s the application that imposes the restriction. For example, A C compiler expects C program filenames to end with .c . "
Question 63,12. _____ and _____ cannot be used in a filename.,"a) /, NULL","b) $,^","c) ., %","d) NULL, $",a,Explanation: UNIX imposes no rules in framing filename extensions but there are some special characters which cannot be used while naming a file. / and NULL are the characters which cannot be used in a filename.
Question 64,"13. Filenames in UNIX are not case-sensitive.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: Since UNIX is sensitive to case, filenames are also. Hence, chap01, Chap01 and CHAP01 are three different files and can exist in the same directory."
Question 65,"14. We should avoid filenames starting with a – (hyphen).a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: Those files which have filename starting with a (-) are difficult to remove and many commands can interpret such filename as an option which could lead to a miserable situation.
Question 66,1. Which command is used for printing the current working directory?,a) HOME,b) cd,c) pwd,d) dir,c,"Explanation: pwd command is used for checking our current directory. Current directory is the directory in which we are currently working. pwd displays the absolute pathname i.e. with respect to the root directory.	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist1'); });	$ pwd/home/user06/Abdullah "
Question 68,2.  Which command is used for changing the current directory?,a) cd,b) cp,c) pwd,d) rm,a,"Explanation: cd (change directory) command is used for moving around the file system. cd command is usually invoked with a argument . After invocation it changes the current directory to the directory specified as argument. Cp command is used for copying files while rm command is used for deleting files.For example: our current directory is /bin/user06 and we want to change our directory to a directory named dir_one which is inside the user06 directory. To do so, type the following:$ cd dir_one$pwd/bin/user06/dir_one"
Question 69,"3. cd command cannot be used without any argument.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: cd command can be used without any arguments. When it used in such a way, then it changes our current directory to home directory."
Question 70,4. Which command is used for creating directories?,a) rmdir,b) mkdir,c) cd,d) cp,b,"Explanation: Directories in UNIX are created using mkdir command. The name of the directory to be created is specified as a argument to the mkdir command. For example, to create a dir named dir_01 in the current directory we can use the following command,$ mkdir dir_01"
Question 71,"5. We can create multiple directories by single invocation of mkdir command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Multiple directories can be created by one mkdir command.	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ mkdir dir_01  dir_02  dir_03"
Question 72,6. What does the following command do?,"a) create dir, dir_01 and dir_02",b) creates dir_02,c) creates dir only,d) throws an error,a,"Explanation: The above command first creates a directory named dir and after that it creates a subdirectory dir_01 under dir. At last, it creates another subdirectory dir_02 under dir_01. Thus a directory tree is formed in which directory dir is the parent directory and dir_01, dir_02 are subdirectories."
Question 73,7. Sometimes we are unable to create a directory because ______________,a) the directory may already exist in the current directory,b) there may be a ordinary file by the same name innthe current directory,c) the permissions set for the current directory does not allow the creation,"d) the directory may exist, there may be a ordinary file, the permissions set for the current directory does not allow the creation",d,Explanation: Sometimes we are not able to create directory because of multiple reasons as stated above. 
Question 74,8. Which command is used for removing an empty directory?,a) mkdir,b) rmdir,c) del,d) remove,b,"Explanation: rmdir command is used for removing directories provided the directory should be empty. For example, to remove a directory named dir_001 in the current directory type the following command on the terminal.$ rmdir  dir_001 "
Question 76,"9. Multiple directories can be removed using single rmdir command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Like mkdir command, we can delete multiple directories using one shot of rmdir command. While deleting directories and subdirectories, a reverse logic is applied i.e. first the subdirectories or the child directories are removed and then their parent directories.$  rmdir  dir   dir/dir_01/dir_02"
Question 77,"10. For creating or removing directories, the user must be positioned above the directory  or in the parent directory of the directory, on which the operation is to performed.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: For performing any operation on the file system, the user must be hierarchically above the directory or should be in parent directory of the directory on which the operation is to be performed. Without following this rule, the user will not be able to perform any operation on the file system."
Question 78,"11. If rmdir dir001 fails, what could be the reason(s)?",a) dir001 doesn’t exists,b) dir001 is not empty,c) permissions of dir001 doesn’t allow to remove it,"d) dir001 doesn’t exist, dir001 is not empty and permissions of dir001 doesn’t allow to remove it",d,"Explanation: There could be multiple reasons which could lead to failure while removing a directory. Major reasons could be:•	 directory doesn’t exists.•	 directory is not empty.•	 permissions of directory doesn’t allow to remove it. "
Question 79,"12. pwd and echo $HOME will display the same output.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: pwd is used for displaying the absolute pathname of our current working dircectory while $HOME displays the absolute pathname of our home directory.$ echo  $HOME/home/user08			    // displays home directory$ pwd/home/user08/documents/template	   // displays current directory "
Question 81,"1.  Pathname is a sequence of symbols and directories indicating the location of a file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: pathname is basically a sequence of symbols and filenames which indicates the location of our file in the hierarchical file system. pathname is of two types – absolute and relative pathnames. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist1'); });	$ pwd/users09/dir01/documents	// pathname indicating our current directory"
Question 82,2.  What is an absolute pathname?, a) pathname relative to parent directory, b) pathname relative to root (/), c) pathname relative to parent and current directory, d) pathname relative to current directory,b,"Explanation: When a file’s pathname is determined with respect to the root(/), such a pathname is called absolute pathname. No two files in a UNIX system can have same absolute pathnames. Two files can be of same name but in different directories hence their pathname would be different from each other. For example, /bin/user06/dir_01  is an example of absolute pathname."
Question 83,3. What is a relative pathname?,a) pathname relative to parent directory,b) pathname relative to root (/),c) pathname relative to parent and current directory,d) pathname relative to current directory,c,"Explanation: When a file uses its parent or current directory as a reference for navigation, such a pathname is called absolute pathname.$ pwd/user08/kumar/documents/directory001	// absolute pathname"

(-u) copies only when the source file is newer than the destination file. "
Question 134,4. What is the correct syntax for copying multiple files with a filename starting as ‘file’ into another file named as  ‘directory_one’?,a) cp -i file  directory_one,b) cp -R file  directory/directory_one,c) cp file*  directory_one,d) none of the mentioned,c,"Explanation:  For copying multiple files with a common starting name such as (file, file001, file.txt, fileone.jpg, file-archive.zip) we use (“*”). An asterisk (“*”) is a wildcard — a special character which expands to match other characters.  For example,  cp file*  directory_one will copy all the files whose name will be starting with ‘file’  into  ‘directory_one’ file. "
Question 135,5. How can we copy an entire directory under another directory?,a) using -R option,b) using -a option,c) using -u option,d) none of the mentioned,a,"Explanation:  -R option is used to copy an entire directory structure into another one recursively. Here recursively means that the command can descend a directory and examine all the files in its subdirectories and then it will copy the entire structure. For example,  cp  -R prog_one  new_prog. It will create a copy of contents of entire directory prog_one to new_prog if new_prog does not exist. Otherwise, if new_prog exists as a directory,  then the whole structure of prog_one will be copied under new_prog as a subdirectory."
Question 136,6. How can we copy a file into our current directory?,a) cp file1,b) cp file1,c) cp file*,d) none of the mentioned,b,"Explanation:  For creating a copy of a file into our current working directory we use the shorthand notation (.).

Question 137,7. What does the following command do?,a) copy all files to directory dir_file,b) update all files,c) delete all files,d) update all files in the current working directory and copy newer ones to directory dir_file,d,Explanation:  (-u) option is used with cp command to update files and copy only when the source file is newer than destination file. So the above command will update all files in the current working directory and copy newer ones to directory dir_file.
Question 138,"8. Sometimes it is not possible to copy a file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Sometimes it may happen that we cannot copy a file because of the permissions associated with it. For example, If the permissions associated with a file are read-protected then we cannot copy the file."
Question 139,9. What does -i option do?,a) interactive copying,b) recursively copying,c) updating,d) none of the mentioned,a,"Explanation: (-i) option is used for interactive copying. It means that suppose if we invoke a command like cp file1  file2 and if file2 already exists then it will be overwritten which can be a nightmare for many users. To avoid this, we use -i option. It provides us with a warning before overwriting a file. It asks the user whether to overwrite the file or not. The syntax is cp  -i source_file  dest_file.$ cp  -i  file_01  fo_02cp: overwrites fo_02 (yes/no)?             // asks before overwriting"
Question 140,"10. To copy multiple files, the last destination file should be a directory.a) Falseb) TrueView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation:  We can copy multiple files using a single invocation of cp command.

Question 147,"2. We can delete multiple files using single rm command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Multiple files can be deleted in a single go using rm command. All we need to do is, provides multiple filenames as arguments to the rm command.$ rm  file1  file2  file3 "
Question 149,3. To delete all files in a directory we use ______________,a) rmdir *,b) mv *,c) rm *,d) del *,c,"Explanation: To delete all files in a directory, use (*) with rm command. It acts as a meta-character and delete all files without displaying any message on the terminal. So use this command cautiously."
Question 150,"4. Some files cannot be deleted using rm command because of the permissions associated with it.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,:,Explanation: Whether we are able to remove a file depends on the permissions associated with the file/directory. So sometime it may happen that permissions of a file won’t allow us to delete it.
Question 151,5. Which option is used with rm command for interactive deletion?,a) –i,b) –f,c) –r,d) –R,a,"Explanation: Like in cp command, -i option is also used with rm command for interactive deletion.

Write permission means that the file can be edited while execute permission (for a directory) means that we can “pass through” the directory file for searching subdirectories."
Question 238,3. Permissions of a file are represented by which of the following characters?,"a) r,w,x","b) e,w,x","c) x,w,e","d) e,x,w",a,"Explanation: A file can have three types of permissions; read, write and execute which is represented by characters r, w and x respectively."
Question 239,4. A file named abd.txt has the following set of permissions,,,,,,
Question 240," All the three operations i.e read, write and execute can be performed on the file by file owner, group owner and others.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: UNIX provides a three tired file protection system that determines the file access rights i.e. the permissions are dived into three groups as	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	r w x     r w x     r w xThe first group has all the three permissions i.e. file is readable, writable and executable by the file owner.The second group also has all the three permissions i.e. file is readable, writable and executable by the group owner.The third group also has all the three permissions i.e. file is readable, writable and executable by others who are neither a part of the group nor they are an owner of the file.Normally this set of permissions is too dangerous!"
Question 241,"The first group has all the three permissions i.e. file is readable, writable and executable by the file owner.The second group also has all the three permissions i.e. file is readable, writable and executable by the group owner.The third group also has all the three permissions i.e. file is readable, writable and executable by others who are neither a part of the group nor they are an owner of the file.Normally this set of permissions is too dangerous!",,,,,,
Question 242,5. Which of the following symbol is used to indicate the absence of a permission of a file?,a) $,b) &,c) +,d) –,d,"Explanation: ( – ) is used to indicate the absence of a single or set of permissions of a file. For example, if a file has all the three permissions for owner but is only readable by group members and others, then the set of permissions would be,rwx  r--  r--"
Question 243,"6. When we create a file, we are the owner of a file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: In most cases, the user which creates the file is regarded as owner of the file. The owner of the file can create, delete or edit the file or he can change the permissions associated with it."
Question 244,7. What is group ownership?,a) group of users who can access the file,b) group of users who can create the file,c) group of users who can edit the file,d) group of users who can delete the file,a,"Explanation: When the system administrator creates a user account, he assigns the user two parameters; UID (user ID) and GID (group ID). Group id denotes the group to which the user belongs.In simple words, group ownership defines the group to which the file is accessible. "
Question 245,"8. A file has permissions as rwx r– —. A user other than the owner cannot edit the file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Since the second and third group of permissions of a file are r–  and — respectively. So the file is only readable and that too, only by the members of the group to which the file belongs. "
Question 246,"9. If a file is read protected, we can write to the file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,Explanation: If a file is not readable then it is obvious that we cannot write anything to the file. To write anything to a file it should be readable first. But if a file is writable then we can read the file easily but the reverse is not true.
Question 247,10. The write permission for a directory determines that ____________,a) we can write to a directory file,b) we can read the directory file,c) we can execute the directory file,d) we can add or remove files to it,d,Explanation: The write permission of a directory does not imply that we can write to the directory. Only kernel is allowed to do that. It simply means that we can create or remove files from the directory.
Question 248,"11. If the file is write-protected and the directory has write permission then we cannot delete the file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: The term ‘write-protected’ has a limited meaning in the UNIX file system. A file which is write protected cannot be written, but it can be removed if the directory has write permission."
Question 249,12. What is execute permission?,a) permission to execute the file,b) permission to delete the file,c) permission to rename the file,d) permission to search or navigate through the directory,d,"Explanation: Executing a directory does not make any sense, execute permission simply means that a user can “pass through” the directory while searching for subdirectories. When we use pathname with any command we should have execute permission for each of the directories involved in the complete pathname. For example,cd  users/users06/abd/dir01/file01.txt    // all directories should have execute permission."
Question 250,13. Which of the following is default permission set for ordinary files?,a) rw-rw-rw-,b) rwxrwxrwx,c) r–r–r–,d) rw-rw-rwx,a,"Explanation: The default permission set for an ordinary file is rw-rw-rw i.e. it is readable and writable by owner, group member and others."
Question 251,14. Which of the following is default permission set for directories?,a) rw-rw-rw-,b) rwxrwxrwx,c) r–r–r–,d) rw-rw-rwx,b,"Explanation: The default permission set for an ordinary file is rwxrwxrwx i.e. it is readable, writable, executable by owner, group members and others."
Question 252,15. A file owner does not have a permission to edit the file but the group to which the file owner belong do have the permission to edit it. Can owner edit the file?,a) Yes,b) No,c) Cannot be defined,d) Error will be encountered,b,"Explanation: The file owner cannot edit the file because the owner’s permission overrides the group’s permission. In other words, the priority of owner’s permission is greater than group’s permission."
Question 253,1. Which command is used to change the permissions of a file?,a) chmod,b) ch,c) chown,d) chgrp,a,Explanation: The chmod (change mode) command is used to change the permissions of files. This command can only be run by the owner of the file or by the super user.
Question 254,"2. chmod command can take multiple filenames as arguments.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: We can change permissions of multiple files by using chmod command once. To change permissions of multiple files simultaneously just use the chmod command with multiple filenames as arguments.
Question 255,3.  chmod command can be used in ____ ways.,a) 3,b) 2,c) 5,d) 0,b,Explanation: chmod command can be used in two manners i.e. relative (changes are specified to the current permissions) and absolute (final permissions are specified).
Question 256,4. The expression used with chmod command to change permissions in a relative manner contains ____ components.,a) 5,b) 2,c) 4,d) 3,d,"Explanation: chmod command takes an expression as its arguments which comprises of some letters and symbols. The expression comprises of three components:-•    User category (user, group, others)•    The operation to be performed (assign or remove a permission)•    Type of permission (read, write, execute) "
Question 257,5. Which of the following characters specify the user and group category?,a) ‘u’ and ‘g’,b) ‘g’ and ‘o’,c) ‘us’ and ‘gr’,d) ‘u’ and ‘o’,a,"Explanation: Each character specifies a particular category of users as follows:‘u’ stands for a user, ‘g’ for ‘group’‘o’ for ‘others’. "
Question 258,6. Which of the following symbol is used with chmod to assign permission to a file?,a) –,b) /,c) +,d) *,c,"Explanation: To assign and remove permissions from a file, (+) and (-) symbols are used respectively.‘+’ symbol will assign a permission‘-‘ symbol will remove a permission "
Question 259,"7. To assign execute permission to the user (owner) for a file named file01.txt, which of the following command will be used?",a)  chmod u+r file01.txt,b) chmod u+w file01.txt,c) chmod  u-x file01.txt,d) chmod u+x file01.txt,d,"Explanation: To assign execute permission to the user, above command is stated as follows: u    -  for specifying the category of user. +    - for assigning permission. x    - to specify execute permission. "
Question 261,8. What does the following command do?,"a) assign write permission to users, group and others",b) assign write permission to the user (owner) only,c) assign write permission to group and others,d) command not executable,a,"Explanation: The string ugo combines all the three categories –user, group and others while (+) is used to assign the permission. ‘w’ specifies the write operation."
Question 262,9. Which character is used to replace ‘ugo’ string in chmod command?,a) a,b) v,c) x,d) o,a,"Explanation: UNIX offers a shorthand symbol ‘a’ (all) that acts as a synonym for the ‘ugo’ string which represents all the categories of users.$ chmod a+w  file01		// assign write permission to user, group and others."
Question 263,"10. To remove write permission from group and others, which one of the following commands will be used?",a) chmod  go+w file01,b) chmod  go-w file01,c) chmod  ug-w file01,d) chmod a-w file01,b,Explanation: To remove a certain permission from a category of users we use (-) symbol. So above command will remove write permission from group and others.
Question 264,"1. While changing permissions in an absolute manner, we explicitly set all the nine bits irrespective of the previous permissions of the file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: The expression used used by chmod in an absolute manner is a string of three octal numbers (base 8).  A set of 3 bits represent a single octal digit.•    Read permission –4 (100 in octal)•    Write permission –2(010 in octal)•    Execute permission –1(001 in octal)For each category, we add up these numbers. For example, if we have to set read and write permission then an octal number will be 110 (4+2)."
Question 265,2. What are the permission of file01 after executing this command?,a) rwxrwxrwx,b) rw-rw-rw,c) r–r–r–,d) r–r—-,a,"Explanation: Since the octal number for the above command is 777 and we know that 7(111) represents all the three sets of permissions (read, write and execute) for a category of user. As we have 777, the file is readable, writable and executable by anyone."
Question 266,"3. A file named file01 should be readable, writable and executable only by the user(owner). Which one of the following set of command will be used?",a) chmod 700 file01,b) chmod 000 file01,c) chmod  477 file01,d) chmod  777 file01,a,"Explanation: Since 7(111) represents read, write, execute permission. So 700 will represent read, write, execute permission only for the user (owner)."
Question 267,"4. A file has a permission set as 000 i.e. — — —. Can the file be deleted?a) Yesb) NoView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: The file having permission set as 000 is useless i.e. it is not readable, writable or executable. But we can delete the file using directory permissions. If the directory has write permission, we can easily add or remove a file from it."
Question 268,"5. A file has a permission set as 777 ie rwxrwxrwx but the directory permissions are 400. If the user tries to delete the file, will he be able to do it?a) Yesb) NoView Answer",,,,,b,Explanation: Since we have only read permissions for the directory and the directory permissions do not allow us to add or remove a file from it we cannot delete a file no matter what is the permission set of that file.
Question 269,6. Which command is used to change the ownership of a file?,a) chmod,b) change,c) ch,d) chown,d,"Explanation: For changing the file ownership, we use the chown command. chown transfer the ownership of a file to another user. The command requires the user-ID (UID) of the recipient.To change the ownership of a file from user01 to user02, use the following commands:1. Change your status to a super user.2. # chown mash  file01            // # indicates another shell 3. exit "
Question 271,7. Which option is used for the recursive functioning of chmod command?,a) -R,b) -r,c) -l,d) -i,a,"Explanation: Like other UNIX commands, chmod can also descend a directory hierarchy and apply the expression to every file and subdirectories it finds. This is done using -R option. For example,chmod -R a+w  dir01This command will make all files and subdirectories found in the tree walk executable by all users. "
Question 272,This command will make all files and subdirectories found in the tree walk executable by all users. ,,,,,,
Question 273,8. Which command is used to change the group owner of the file?,a) chown,b) ch,c) chgrp,d)chmod,c,Explanation: A user can change the group owner of a file but only to that group to which he belongs. A user can belong to more than one group and the one shown in /etc/psswd is the user’s main group. 
Question 274,"9. A user can change the group ownership of a file to another group to which he does not belong.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,Explanation: Group ownership can be changed only to that group to which the user also belongs otherwise a user cannot change the group ownership of a file to another group to which he does not belong.
Question 275,"10. Like chmod, chown and chgrp can also use ___ option.", a) -R,b) -r,c) -x,d) -i,a,"Explanation: Like chmod, chown and chgrp use the -R option to perform their operations in a recursive manner."
Question 276,"11. UNIX allows the system administrator to use only chown to change both owner and group.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: UNIX provides a special privilege for the system administrator to change both the owner and group using chown command only. The syntax requires two arguments to be separated by a (:). For example, chown  abd:grp01  file01.txt     // ownership to abd, group to grp01"
Question 277,12. Which symbol is used to change permissions for hidden files?,a) .,b) &,c) $,d) *,a,"Explanation: To change permissions for hidden files, use the (.) symbol with chmod command. $ chmod 755  .    // works on hidden files "
Question 279,1. Which editor is used by the UNIX system to edit files?,a) vi,b) notepad,c) word,d) notepad++,a,"Explanation: It doesn’t matter what kind of work we are doing on a UNIX system, we always need an editor to edit some system files or ordinary files. For this purpose, vi editor is used in UNIX. Currently, vim (vi improved) is an improved version which is supported by LINUX systems."
Question 280,2. What does the following command do?,a) open file named file001,b) edit file named file001,c) delete a file named file001,d) open file if it exists else creates a new file,d,"Explanation: vi editor can be used for creating and editing files. In the above command, if file001 already exists, then the contents of the file will be displayed. Otherwise, an empty file named file001 will be created."
Question 281,3. Which option is used by vi editor to open a file in read mode only?,a) -r,b) -R,c) -d,d) -f,b,"Explanation: To open an existing file in read-mode only, -R is used with the filename (as an argument). For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ vi  -R  file001       // open file in read mode only"

Here it is used as solitary to match all filenames.
Question 410,4. Which command would be most suitable to remove the following files?,dirx  diry  dirz  dirzw,a) rm dir?,b) rm dirx  diry  dirz  dirzw,c) rm *,a,"Explanation: Since we know that ? can be used to match a single character. In the above scenario, all the filenames are same except that the last character in all filenames is different. So we can use the ? meta-character."
Question 411,5. Which of the following files will not be deleted using “rm chap??” ?,a) chap01,b) chap02,c) chaptd,d) chactd,d,"Explanation: Since ? is used to match a single character, ?? can match two characters. So the above command will remove all files with a filename starting with a prefix ‘chap’, followed by any two characters."
Question 412,6. Which of the following command will list all the hidden filenames in our directory having at least three characters after the dot (.) ?,a) ls,b) ls -a,c) ls  .???*,d) ls *,c,"Explanation: The * doesn’t match all files beginning with a (.) dot. So if we need to lists all the hidden filenames in our directory having at least three characters after the dot (.) we can use the following command,$ ls  .???*.bash_pro    .chap01        .netspak    .profile        //list of hidden files"
Question 413,7.  * and ? cannot match ____,a) /,b) $,c) .,d) / and .,d,"Explanation: There are two things which * and ? cannot match. First is, they cannot match filenames starting with a dot (.). Second is, they cannot match / in the pathname. For example, we cannot use cd  /usr?local  to switch to /usr/local. It will generate an error."
Question 414,8.  rm  chap0[1234] will delete all of the following files.,,,,,,
Question 415,"a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: We can frame restrictive patterns with the character class. The character class comprises a set of characters enclosed by the rectangular brackets, [ and ], but it matches a single character in the class. For example, the pattern [abcd] is a character class that can match a single character – an a, b, c or d. Similarly, we can combine the character class with any string or any other wildcard expression. Hence, the command rm chap0[1234] will delete chap01 chap02 chap03 chap04."
Question 416,9.  Which of the following files will not be listed using the following command?,a) chap02,b) chap05,c) chap01,d) chap04,b,"Explanation: Range specification is also possible inside the class using a hyphen (-). The two characters on either side of it form the range of characters to be matched. So the command ls  chap0[1-4] can match chap01, chap02, chap03, chap04. But chap05 cannot be matched because the range inside the character class is from 1 to 4."
Question 417,10. Which of the following symbol is used for negating the character class?,a) .,b) *,c)!,d) %,c,"Explanation: We can use the ! as the first symbol for negating the character class. For example,*.[!tx]        //matches all filenames with single character extension but not .t or .x [!a-zA-Z]*    // matches all filenames that don’t begin with a alphabetic character."
Question 418,11. Which of the following shell doesn’t support ! symbol for negating the character class?,a) bash,b) bash,c) POSIX,d) C,d,"Explanation: The ! symbol cannot be used to negate a character class in a C shell. In fact, C shell doesn’t provide any mechanism for doing so."
Question 419,"12. The command cd * will work.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: As we know that cd command is used for changing directories, the command cd * will work only when there is only one file in the current directory and that file should also be a directory. Otherwise, this command is invalid."
Question 420,1. Providing a backslash (\) before the wild card to remove its special meaning is called _____,a) escaping,b) quoting,c) listing,d) pattern matching,a,"Explanation: We know that shell uses some special characters to match filenames or perform other search and replace operations. But if the filename itself contains those special characters, then it could be a great nuisance. For dealing with such files we use escaping and quoting.Escaping means providing a backslash (\) before the wild card so that its special meaning could be removed. For example, if we want to remove a file named chap*, then using the command rm chap* will delete all the file beginning with a prefix ’chap’. In this situation, we can use the following command,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist1'); });	$  rm chap\*"
Question 421,2.Enclosing the wild card or the entire pattern within quotes is called ___,a) escaping,b) quoting,c) listing,d) pattern matching,b,"Explanation: There is another way to turn off the meaning of the metacharacter. When a command argument is enclosed in quotes, the meaning of all special characters is turned off. This method is called quoting. For example,$ echo ‘\’        //displays a \"
Question 422,"3. To remove the file named my document.txt, which one of the following commands will be used?",a) rm my\ document.txt,b) rm my document.txt,c) rm *,d) rm my_document.txt,a,"Explanation: Apart from metacharacters, there are other characters that are special like the space character. The shell uses it to delimit command line arguments. So to remove the file my document.txt we can use escaping. The backslash will make the shell to ignore the space. Hence file will be removed easily."
Question 423,"4. We can escape the \ itself using escaping.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Sometimes we may need to interpret the \ itself literally. To do so we need another \ before it. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ echo \\        // displays \"
Question 424,5.  For escaping the newline character we can use ____,a) /,b) \,c) ?,d) \n,b,"Explanation: The newline character is also special, it marks the end of the command line. Some command lines that uses several arguments can be long enough to overflow to the next line. To split the wrapped line into two lines, make sure you input a \ before pressing [Enter]."
Question 425,6. The output of the following command is ______________,a) undefined output,b) erroneous,c) hello,d) The special character $ echo hello and | ls chap*,d,"Explanation: Quoting is another way to turn off the meaning of a meta-character. When a command argument is enclosed in quotes, the meanings of all enclosed special characters are turned off."
Question 426,"7. Double quotes are more permissive than single quotes and allow the evaluation of the $ and ` itself.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: When a command argument is enclosed in single quotes, the meaning of all enclosed special characters is turned off. But when we enclose the same in double quotes, we cannot protect the $ and ` (backquote). For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('Sanfoundry_300x250_320x50_BTF_1'); });	$ echo ‘$SHELL’      // displays $SHELL$ echo “$SHELL”     // evaluates $SHELL and then display"
Question 427,8. Which of the following command will remove the file named * ?,a) rm *,b) rm ‘*’,c) rm \*,d) rm ‘*’ and rm \*,d,Explanation: To suppress the nature of wildcard * we can use either escaping or quoting. The \ symbol will suppress the feature of wildcard and will remove the file named *. Similarly using quoting we can turn off the meaning of the meta character.
Question 428,"1. Redirection is a process of switching of the standard stream of data.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: Redirection is a process in which switching of the standard stream of data is performed so that it comes from a source other than its default source or so that it goes to some destination other than its default destination.
Question 429,2. How many files are used for representing different streams?,a) 1,b) 2,c) 4,d) 3,d,"Explanation: The shell associates three files with the terminal –two for display and one for the keyboard. These special files are actually streams of characters which many commands see as input and output. Each stream is associated with a default device –which is terminal. These three files are:•    Standard Input•    Standard output•    Standard error"
Question 430,3. Which stream is connected to the display?,a) standard input,b) standard output,c) standard error,d) error,b,"Explanation:  Standard output is the file (or stream)  which is used for representing output, and is connected to the display. Each command which uses the display for its output will find this file always open and available. The file will be automatically closed after the command has completed its execution."
Question 431,4. Which stream is used for representing error messages?,a) standard input,b) standard output,c) standard error,d) error,a,Explanation: The standard error (or stream) is used for representing error messages that emanate from the command or shell. This stream is also connected to the display as error messages are displayed on the terminal.
Question 432,"5. The command wc < sample.txt will count data from the file sample.txt.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: When wc is used without any arguments it will read the data from the default source which is a keyboard. In the above command, redirection symbol > is present. The following steps are performed:1. On seeing the <, the shell opens the disk file, sample.txt for reading.2. wc performs its execution and displays the output."
Question 433,6. Which symbol is used for taking input from both file and standard input?,a) &,b) %,c) –,d) $,c,"Explanation: When a command takes input from multiple sources –say a file and standard input, the – symbol is used to indicate the sequence of taking input. For example,$ cat  -  foo          // first take input from standard input and then foo$ cat  foo  -  bar    // first take input from foo then from standard input and after that from bar"
Question 434,7. Which of the following symbol(s) can be used to redirect the output to a file or another program?,a) |,b) >,c) >>,"d) |, > and >>",d,"Explanation: All commands displaying output on the terminal actually write to the standard output file as a stream of characters and not directly to the terminal as such. The symbol > will replace the default destination (terminal) with any file by using the > operator, followed by the filename while the symbol >> is used to append to a file. | is used to give input to another program."
Question 435,"8. The >> symbol is used to overwrite the existing file if it exists.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: The shell provides the >> symbol (right chevron used twice) to append to an existing file. For example,$ wc  sample.txt >> newfile    //count data in newfile and append it to sample.txt but doesn’t                //disturb contents of sample.txt"
Question 436,9. Which file descriptor is used to represent standard error stream?,a) 0,b) 1,c) 2,d) 3,c,"Explanation: Each of the three standard files is represented by a number called as a file descriptor. A file is opened using its pathname, but subsequent read and write operations identify the file by this file descriptor. Whenever we enter an incorrect command or try to open a non-existent file, certain diagnostic messages are displayed onto the terminal. This is the standard error stream whose default destination is the terminal."
Question 437,10. We can redirect the error message to file named newfile using __________ command.,a) cat  foo  errorfile,b) cat  foo >errorfile,c) cat errorfile>foo,d) cat foo 2>errorfile,d,Explanation: Redirecting standard error requires the 2> symbol. Suppose if foo doesn’t exist then an error message ‘ cannot open foo’ will be generated but we can send this message to another file. But here > and >> cannot be used. We have to use 2> symbol as the file descriptor number 2 represents the standard error stream.
Question 438,1. The category of commands which uses both standard input and standard output are called ____,a) directory oriented commands,b) standard input commands,c) filters,d) standard output commands,c,"Explanation: UNIX commands can be grouped into four categories:Directory-oriented (mkdir,rmdir)Commands like ls, pwd that write to standard outputCommands like lp that read from standard inputFilters – commands which use both standard input and standard output (like bc)"
Question 439,2. The contents of file001 are:,,,,,,
Question 440,What will be the contents of result.txt?,a) undefined,b) erroneous,"c) 429467296, 1250",d) 1650,c,"Explanation: We can redirect bc’s standard input to come from file001 and save the output in another file named result.txt. bc obtained the expressions from the redirected standard input, processed them and sent out the results to a redirected output stream. Here bc command is used as a filter."
Question 441,3. Which of the following files are known as special files in UNIX?,a) sample.txt,b) /dev/null,c) /dev/tty,d) /dev/null and /dev/tty,d,"Explanation: There are two special files named /dev/null and /dev/tty which is used in UNIX for special purposes. For example, if we want to check whether the program runs successfully without seeing its output on the screen or may not want to save output in a file either. For this purpose, a special file /dev/null is used. It accepts any stream without growing in size. The second file /dev/tty is the one used for indicating one’s terminal."
Question 442,"4. The size of /dev/null is always zero.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: UNIX has a special file that simply accepts any stream without growing in size. This file is /dev/null. This file is used for redirecting error messages away from the terminal so that they don’t appear on the screen. This file is pseudo-device because like other device files, it’s not associated with any physical device."
Question 443,5. Which symbol is used to redirect error messages to /dev/null?,a) %,b) $,c) >,d) <,c,"Explanation: As we redirect our output using > symbol to other files in simple commands, this technique can also be used to redirect error messages to /dev/null file. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ cmp  file01  file02 &gt;  /dev/null"
Question 444,6. Which file is used for indicating terminals?,a) /dev/tty,b) /dev/null,c) terminal file,d) device file,a,"Explanation: /dev/tty is another special file which is used for representing one’s terminal. Consider user1 is working on terminal /dev/pts/1 and user 2 is working on /dev/pts/2. Then, both the users can refer to their own terminals with the same filename. For example, if user 1 issues the command$ who &gt; /dev/ttyThen, the list of users is sent to the terminal he is currently using — dev/pts/1. Similarly, user 2 can also issue the same command to see the output on his terminal, /dev/pts/2./dev/tty can be accessed by multiple users without conflict. "
Question 445,"Then, the list of users is sent to the terminal he is currently using — dev/pts/1. Similarly, user 2 can also issue the same command to see the output on his terminal, /dev/pts/2./dev/tty can be accessed by multiple users without conflict. ",,,,,,
Question 446,7. Which symbol is used to connect different streams?,a) |,b) >,c) <,d) ~,a,"Explanation: The shell can connect different streams using a special operator called pipe (|) and avoid creation of disk file. We can connect two commands using this operator so that one command can take the output of other as its input. For example,$ who | wc -l        // count number of lines  in the output of who command."
Question 447,"8. We can use the > symbol along with pipe in a command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: There is no restriction on the number of commands we can use in a pipeline except that we should know the behavioural properties of these commands to place there. For example, consider this command:$ ls  | wc  -l  > output.txt    // number of lines counted by wc command from the output of ls //are stored in a file named output.txt."
Question 448,9. What is the output of the following command?,a) total size of .c files,b) size of each .c file,c) undefined,d) erroneous,a,Explanation: We can make the command ignorant of its source using the pipeline. Above command is also an example of the same. It will simply display the total size of those files having a .c extension in the current directory.
Question 449,"10. In a pipeline, the command on the left of | must use standard output and one on the right must use standard input.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: There is a restriction which is applied while using a pipeline. In a pipeline, the command on the left of | must use standard output (stream)  and one on the right must use standard input (stream). Otherwise, an error will be generated or the output will be erroneous."
Question 450,11. Which command saves one copy of character stream in a file and store the other to standard output?,a) who,b) ls,c) tee,d) wc,c,"Explanation: tee command handles a character stream by duplicating its input. It saves one copy in a file and writes the other to standard output. For example,$ who  | tee  user.txtAbove command will the save the output of who command in a file named user.txt as well as it will also display the output of who command on the terminal."
Question 451,Above command will the save the output of who command in a file named user.txt as well as it will also display the output of who command on the terminal.,,,,,,
Question 452,"12. tee is an internal command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,Explanation: tee is an external command and not a feature of the shell. tee command handles a character stream by duplicating its input. It saves one copy in a file and writes the other to standard output.
Question 453,13. Which of the following is not true about tee command?,a) it is a feature of the shell,b) it is an external command,c) tee command duplicates its input,d) tee is an internal command,a,Explanation:  tee command is not a feature of the shell. tee command handles a character stream by duplicating its input. It saves one copy in a file and writes the other to standard output. It is an external command.
Question 454,"14. Apart from its use in redirection, /dev/tty can also be used as an argument to some commands.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: /dev/tty can be used as an argument to some UNIX commands. Because the terminal is also a file we can use the device name /dev/tty as an argument to some commands like tee. For example,$ who  |  tee  /dev/tty  | wc  -l            // same as who | wc  -lIn the above command, tee saved the output of who in /dev/tty, thus effectively showing it on the screen and wc -l counted the number of lines from another stream."
Question 455,"In the above command, tee saved the output of who in /dev/tty, thus effectively showing it on the screen and wc -l counted the number of lines from another stream.",,,,,,
Question 456,1. Shell enables one or more arguments to be obtained from the standard output of another command. This feature is called _________,a) command substitution,b) argument substitution,c) shell substitution,d) korn,a,"Explanation: Apart from a pipeline, shell enables connecting of two commands in another way. Shell enables one or more arguments to be obtained from the standard output of another command. This feature is called command substitution. For example, to display output like:	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist1'); });	Today’s date is Sat  Jan 05 17:25:41  IST 2002We can use the following command$ echo “Today’s date is `date`”        // date is an argument to echo command"
Question 457,2. Which of the following meta-character is used in command substitution?,a) `,b) ‘,c) “,d) >,a,"Explanation: When scanning the command line, the shell looks for another metacharacter i.e. ` (the backquote) usually placed on the top-left of our keyboard, and it should not be confused with a single quote (‘). "
Question 458,"3.  Command substitution is enabled in single quotes also.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: Command substitution is enabled only when we use double quotes. If we use single quotes, it will not work. For example,$ echo ‘today’s date is `date` ‘Output will be: today’s date is `date$ echo “today’s date is `date` “Output will be: today’s date is  Sat  Jan 05 17:25:41  IST 2017 "
Question 460,4. POSIX recommends the use of ____ instead of archaic `command ` for command substitution.,a) |,b) #,c) %,d) $,d,"Explanation: POSIX recommends the use of the form $(command) instead of archaic `command` for command substitution. For example, to display the date using command substitution use the following command:$ echo The date is $(date)Output: The date is  Sat  Jan 05 17:25:41  IST 2017 "
Question 462,5. Which of the following shell doesn’t support the command substitution using $ recommended by POSIX?,a) Korn,b) bash,c) C,d) bourne,d,Explanation: Whether or not we use POSIX notation for command substitution is something up to the user. But we should make sure that we do not have to run our shell scripts with the Bourne shell because $(command) is not supported by Bourne shell. 
Question 463,6. Which symbol is used for assigning a value to variables?,a) $,b) &,c) =,d) @,c,"Explanation: The shell supports variables that are useful both in the command line and shell scripts. These variables are called shell variables like pwd.  A variable assignment is of the form variable=value(no spaces around =). For example,$ count=10        // a variable named count is assigned a value of 10 "
Question 465,7.  Which symbol is used for evaluation of variables?,a) $,b) &,c) =,d) @,a,"Explanation: The shell supports variables that are useful both in the command line and shell scripts. These variables are called shell variables like TERM and SHELL.  A variable assignment is of the form variable=value(no spaces around =), but its evaluation requires the $ as a prefix to the variable name. For example,$ count=10$ echo $count        // output will be 10"
Question 466,8. Which of the following is a correct initialization of variables to null strings?,a) x=,b) x=’ ‘,c) x=” “,"d) x=, x=’ ‘, x=” “",d,Explanation: All shell variables are initialized to null strings by a string. While explicit assignment of null strings can be performed with x=’ ‘ or x=” “ or x= 
Question 467,9. A variable can be removed using _____,a) unset,b) readonly,c) del,d) bash,a,"Explanation: A variable can be removed using the unset command. unset in an internal command. For example, if we want to undefine a variable x then,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('Sanfoundry_300x250_320x50_BTF_1'); });	$ unset  x"
Question 468,"10. readonly command is used to protect a variable from reassignment.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: A variable can be protected from reassignment by readonly command. unset is also an internal command. For example, to protect a variable x from reassignment use the following command,$ readonly  x            // x can’t be reassigned now "
Question 470,11. C shell uses which command for assigning values to variables?,a) =,b) set,c) unset,d) $,b,"Explanation: The C shell uses the set statement to set variables. There is a restriction that there either has to be whitespace on both sides of = or none at all. For example, for assigning a value to a variable named count, use the following command:$ set count=1 Or $ set count=1 "
Question 472,"12. The variable assignment as x = 10 (whitespace on both sides of =) will work if we are not using C shell?a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: If we are using any other shell other than C shell, the assignment in the form x = 10 will produce an error because the shell will interpret x as a command and =,10 as its arguments. "
Question 473,13. What will the result when we evaluate this statement?,a) output of pwd command along with string pwd=,b) undefined output,c) erroneous,d) directory variable will hold string pwd,a,"Explanation: In the above statement, the string pwd, = and the output of pwd command are concatenated and saved in the directory variable. So the above statement will evaluate the current working directory as:pwd=/home/usr10/doc "
Question 475,14. Which of the following is not a system defined variable?,a) $PATH,b) $HOME,c) $SHELL,d) $cd,d,Explanation: PATH is the shell variable which stores the list of directories that the shell searches for locating commands. HOME prints our home directory while SHELL prints the absolute pathname of our login shell. cd is a command which is used for changing directories or moving through file hierarchy. 
Question 476,15. Which of the following is an invalid variable?,a) _user,b) us01,c) -txtfile,d) txt123,c,"Explanation: UNIX restricts some rule for defining a variable. A variable name must begin with either an underscore (_) or alphanumeric character followed by one or more alphanumeric or underscore characters.Following are some valid variable names:User01        user_01    _user67Following are some invalid variable names:2_var        user!        -textfile"
Question 477,16. Command substitution requires the command to use ________,a) standard input,b) standard output,c) standard error,d) all of the above,b,Explanation: The shell enables one or more command arguments to be obtained from the standard output of another command. This feature is called command substitution and it requires the command to use the standard output (stream). 
Question 480,1. A process is an instance of  _______ program.,a) waiting,b) executing,c) terminated,d) halted,b,Explanation: A process is simply an instance of a running program. A process passes through many states throughout its life cycle i.e. when it is born until it is executed. After the process has completed it is said to be terminated.
Question 481,2. A process is said to be ____ when it starts its execution.,a) born,b) die,c) waiting,d) terminated,a,Explanation: A process is said to be born when it starts its execution. It is the initial state of a process. The process is assigned to CPU for its execution further.
Question 482,3. When the process has completed its execution it is called ______,a) born,b) terminated,c) waiting,d) exit,d,"Explanation: A process is said to be died or terminated when it has completed its execution either normally or abnormally. As long as the process is running it is in an active state but as soon as the process has completed its execution, the process is said to die."
Question 483,"4. Programs and process are synonymous.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,Explanation:  Program should not be confused with the process. Both differ from each other but very slightly. The process is only an instance of a running program. Until a program hasn’t started its execution it is referred to a program only but as soon it is in execution state it is called as a process.
Question 484,5. Which data structure is used to store information about a process?,a) process control block (pcb),b) array,c) queue,d) program control block,a,Explanation: A process control block is a data structure which is used for storing information about a process. It is also known as task control block and is maintained by the kernel for maintenance of a process. Each process has its own pcb. 
Question 485,6. Some attributes of every process are maintained by the kernel in memory in a separate structure called the ______,a) pcb,b) task control block,c) process table,d) task table,c,Explanation: As every process has some attributes. Some of these attributes are maintained by the kernel in memory in a separate structure called the process table. A process table is simply an array of many pcb’s. Process table contains two major attributes of a process i.e. processed and parent process ID.
Question 486,"7. Process table and process control block store same attributes of a process.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: Both pcb and process table store attributes and information about processes. But the major difference between both is, pcb contains all the information about the process and is used in context switching while process table contains very few attributes of a process like registers, pid, parent pid."
Question 487,8. Each process is identified by a unique integer called ______,a) PID,b) PPID,c) TID,d) PTID,a,Explanation: Each process is uniquely identified by a unique integer called as the Process ID (PID) which is allotted by the kernel when the process is born. This PID is used for controlling the process of killing it.
Question 488,"9. Every process has a parent process.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Just like a file has a parent, every process also has the same.  The parent is also a process and the process born from it is called child process. For example, when we run the cat command a process representing the cat command is started by the shell process. The process started by the shell is called child process and the shell (which could be sh, ksh or any other) is the parent process."
Question 489,10. The parent id of a child is called ______,a) PID,b) PPID,c) TID,d) PTID,b,"Explanation: The parent ID of a child process is called  PPID (parent process ID) and is available as a process attribute. It is common that several processes have the same parent. When several processes have the same parent, it often makes sense to kill the parent process rather than killing each child separately."
Question 490,11. Which process is immediately set up by the kernel when we log on to a UNIX system?,a) shell,b) parent,c) shell,d) bash,a,"Explanation: As we log on to a UNIX system, a process is immediately set up by the kernel. This process represents a UNIX command which may sh (Bourne shell), ksh (Korn shell), csh (C shell) or bash (Bash). This process remains alive until we log out when it is killed by the kernel."
Question 491,"12. To know the PID of your current shell, which command will be used?",a) echo $$,b) echo $,c) $SHELL,d) $PATH,a,"Explanation: The shell’s pathname is stored in SHELL, but it’s PID is stored in a special variable, $$. To know the PID of our current shell, type	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('Sanfoundry_300x250_320x50_BTF_1'); });	$ echo $$        258        // PID of the current shell"
Question 492,"13. The PID of our login shell doesn’t change.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: The PID of our login shell can’t obviously change as long as we are logged in. But when we log out and log in again, our login shell will be assigned a different PID. This knowledge of PID is necessary to control the activities at our terminal."
Question 493,14. What is the PID of the first process that is set up when the system is booted?,a) 1,b) 0,c) any,d) 2,b,"Explanation: Every process has a parent process, we can’t have any orphaned process for a longer time. The ancestry of every process is ultimately traced to the first process (PID 0) that is set up when the system is booted. It’s like the root directory of the system."
Question 494,15. Which of the following command doesn’t create a process?,a) pwd,b) fork,c) cd,d) pwd and cd,d,"Explanation: When we run a command, a process representing the command is started by the shell process but all commands don’t set up processes. Built-in commands of the shell like pwd, cd etc do not create processes."
Question 495,1.  Which command shows some attributes of a process?,a) pid,b) $$,c) ps,d) HOME,c,"Explanation: ps command is used to show some attributes of a process. This command reads through the kernel’s data structures and process tables to fetch the characteristics of a process. By default, ps command displays the processes owned by the user running the command."
Question 496,2. Which of the following attribute is not shown by ps command?,a) PID,b) PPID,c) tty,d) size,d,"Explanation: ps command displays the processes owned by the user running the command. If we execute the command immediately after logging in, it may produce an output like this:$ psPID    TTY        TIME    CMD291    console     0:00     bash        // login shell of this user"
Question 497,3. Which option is used by ps command to get a detailed listing of process attributes?,a) -u,b) -f,c) -l,d) -x,b,"Explanation: ps is a highly variant command; its actual output varies across different flavours. To get a detailed listing of process attributes along with PPID and owner (UID), we have to use the -f option with ps command. For example,$ ps  -fUID    PID    PPID    C    STIME        TTY        TIME    CMDAbd    367    291    0    12:35:16    console      0:00     vi create_user.shRyan    291    1    0    10:24:58     console      0:00    -bash"
Question 498,4. Which option is used by the system administrator for displaying processes of a user?,a) -f,b) -u,c) -a,d) -e,b,"Explanation: The system administrator needs to use the -u (user) option to know the activities of a user. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ ps  -uPID    TTY    TIME    CMD378?    0:05      Xsession339    pts/3    0:00    bash460    pts/5    0:00    dtsession478    pts/5    0:00    vi"
Question 499,"5. The -a option when used with ps command lists processes of all users but doesn’t display the system processes.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: The -a (all) option lists processes of all users but doesn’t display the system processes. For example,PID     TTY      TIME     CMD339     pts/3    0:00    bash460     pts/5    0:00    dtsession478     pts/5    0:00    vi1005    pts/1    0:00    ksh1058    pts/2    0:00    bash"
Question 500,6. Which option is used with ps command to list system processes?,a) -A,b) -a,c) -e,d) –A and -e,d,"Answer: Apart from processes a user generates, a number of system processes keep running all the time. Most of them are not associated with any terminal. To list all process on our machine, we can use either -A or -e option with ps command. But beware, this list could be very long on a busy system."
Question 501,7. What will the output of the following command?,a) processes running on terminal named console,b) undefined output,c) erroneous,d) processes running on the current terminal,a,Explanation: -t is used with ps command along with the terminal name for displaying processes running on the terminal defined in the command.
Question 502,8. There are ___ distinct phases of a process.,a) 2,b) 5,c) 4,d) 3,d,"Explanation: There are three distinct phases of a process which uses three different system calls or functions. A process can be in its initial state when it is created, after that, the process is in execution state when the instructions of a process are being executed. The third phase of a process is waiting state when the process is waiting for some action to be taken."
Question 503,"9. A system call is a programmatic way in which the program requests for the service from the kernel of an operating system.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: A system call often referred to as kernel call, is a request from a computer program for the services of the operating system. Basically, to access the resources or to utilise the services of the operating system, system calls are used by computer programs."
Question 504,10. Which of the following system call is used for creating a new process?,a) read,b) fork,c) wait,d) new,b,"Explanation: A process in UNIX is created using fork() system call. It creates an exact copy of the process that invokes it. Now there will be two processes, one parent process and one child process. The process which invokes the fork system call is called parent process and the new process created is called child process."
Question 505,"11. When fork() is invoked, the child process created gets a new PID.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: The process created using fork is practically identical to that of calling process except for a few parameters like PID. When a process is forked in this manner, the child process gets a new PID."
Question 506,"12. What is the value returned by fork system call, when the creation of child process is unsuccessful?",a) positive integer,b) negative integer,c) zero,d) fractional value,b,"Explanation: fork() system call is used in UNIX for creating new processes. It takes no parameters and returns an integer value. The value returned depends on following cases:Positive value: returned to the parent process. The value contains PID of child process which is created.Negative value: returned if the creation of child process is unsuccessful.Zero: returned to the newly created child process."
Question 507,13. Which system call is used to run a new program?,a) fork,b) wait,c) exec,d) exit,c,"Explanation: Forking creates a new process but it is not enough to run a new program. To do so, the forked child needs to overwrite its own images with the code and data of the new program. This mechanism is called exec and the child process is said to exec a new program."
Question 508,14. Which system call is used by the parent process to wait for the child process to complete?,a) wait,b) exec,c) fork,d) exit,b,Explanation: The parent process executes the wait() system call to wait for the child process to complete. It picks up the exit status of the child and then continues with its other functions.
Question 509,"1. We can run the jobs in the background in UNIX.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Since UNIX is a multitasking system, it allows the user to do more than one job at a time. But there can be only one process in the foreground and the rest of jobs have to run in the background."
Question 510,2. Shell ___ operator is used for running jobs in the background.,a) $,b) #,c) |,d) &,d,"Explanation: The & is the shell operator used to run a process in the background. All we have to do is to terminate the command line with a & symbol, the command will automatically run in the background. For example,$ sort  -o  emp.lst  &        // emp.lst will be sorted but the command will run in background"
Question 511,3. Which command is used for running jobs in the background?,a) nice,b) ps,c) nohup,d) exec,c,"Explanation: The nohup command when prefixed to a command allows execution of the process even after the user has logged out of the system. Background jobs cease to run when a user logs out of the system. This happens because the shell is killed. To avoid this condition, the nohup command can be used. For example,$ nohup  sort  emp.lst  & "
Question 513,"4. It is necessary to terminate the command line with &, even when we are using nohup command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: nohup command allows running jobs in the background even when the user logs out of the system. But it is necessary to terminate the command line with & when using nohup command.
Question 514,5. Which of the following shell(s) allows the user to run jobs in the background even when the user has logged out (without using nohup command)?,a) C,b) bash,c) Korn,d) C and bash,d,"Explanation: Background jobs are terminated automatically when the user logs out. But in C shell and bash shell jobs are not terminated even after the user logs out. While this is not the case with Bourne and Korn shells. In these shells, jobs are aborted as soon as the user logs out."
Question 515,"6. When nohup command is used, shells returns the _____",a) PID,b) PPID,c) tty,d)TTy,a,"Explanation: When the nohup command is used, the shell returns the PID and some shells also display a message. For example,$ nohup sort  emp.lts &859                             // PID returned by the shellSending output to nohup.out    //message displayed"
Question 516,"7. nohup command doesn’t send the standard output of a command to any file.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: Some shells display a message when the nohup command is used. In these shells, nohup command sends the standard output of the command to the file nohup.out. If you don’t get this message then you have to make sure that you’ve taken care of the output using redirection, if necessary."
Question 517,"8. What is the PID of the process who takes the parentage of the process run with nohup command?a) 0b) 1b) 2d) InfiniteView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: The shell dies on logging out but it’s child didn’t. The kernel handles such situations by reassigning the PPID of the orphan process to the system’s init process (PID 1), which is the parent of all shells."
Question 518,9. Which command is used to for executing jobs according to their priority?,a) nohup,b) $,c) &,d) nice,d,"Explanation: Processes in UNIX system are usually executed with equal priority but sometimes it is necessary to complete high priority jobs at the earliest. For this purpose, UNIX offers nice command. For example,$ nice wc emp.lst"
Question 519,"10. It is better to use & with nice command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"UNIX offers the nice command, which is used with the & operator to increase the priority of jobs. More important jobs can have greater access to the system resources. For example,$ nice wc -l emp.lst  &"
Question 520,1. nice command is a ______ command in C shell.,a) internal,b) external,c) built-in,d) directory,c,Explanation: nice is a built-in command in the C shell. nice values are system-dependent and typically range from 1 to 19. A higher nice value implies a lower priority. nice reduces the priority of any process.
Question 521,2. Which option can be used explicitly to reduce the priority of any process.,a) -a,b) -n,c) -o,d) -q,b,"Explanation: nice values are system-dependent and typically range from 1 to 19. We can also specify the nice value explicitly with the -n option but a non-privileged user cannot increase the priority of a process. For example, to increase the priority by 8 times use the following command:$ nice  -n  5  wc  -l emp.lst &"
Question 522,3. Which command is used for premature termination of a process?,a) signal,b) nice,c) kill,d) nohup,c,"Explanation: The kill command is used for premature termination of a process. It usually sends a signal with the intention of killing one or more processes. kill is an internal command in most shells. Kill command uses one or more PID’s as its arguments. For example,$ kill 105        // terminates the job having PID 105"
Question 523,4. Which one of the following command is used for killing the last background job?,a) kill $,b) kill $$,c) kill $!,d) kill !,c,"Explanation: For most shells, the system variable $! Stores the PID of the last background job. So we can kill any process by using kill command. The PID of the job can be seen when & is affixed to a command. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ sort  -o  emp.lst &        467$ kill $!             // kills the sort command"
Question 524,"5. By default, kill uses the SIGTERM signal (15) to terminate the process.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: UNIX often requires to communicate the occurrence of events to process. This is done by sending a signal. The SIGTERM signal (15) is the default signal used by the kill command to terminate processes. 
Question 525,6. Which signal is used with kill command to terminate the process when they ignore the SIGTERM signal (15)?,a) SIGTERM (16),b) SIGTERM(0),c) SIGKILL(9),d) -d,c,"Explanation: By default, the SIGTERM signal (15) is used by the kill command to terminate processes. But sometimes it may happen that some programs ignore it and continue their execution normally. In such a case, the process can be killed by using SIGKILL signal (9). For example, to kill a job with PID 134 use the following command:$ kill -9  134"
Question 526,7. Which option is preferred while killing a process using SIGKILL signal (9)?,a) -p,b) -s,c) -h,d) -d,b,"Explanation: Sometimes it may happen that some programs ignore the SIGTERM signal (15) and continue their execution normally. In such a case, the process can be killed by using SIGKILL signal (9). This signal can’t be generated at the press of a key, so we have to use KILL  with the signal name preceded with -s option. For example, to kill a job with PID 184 use the following command:$ kill -s  KILL 184 "
Question 528,8. Which of the followings command(s) is used to kill the login shell?,a) kill 0,b) kill  -9  $$,c) kill  -s  KILL 0,d) kill  -9  $$ and kill  -s  KILL 0,d,"Explanation: A simple kill command (with TERM) will not kill the login shell. We can kill the login shell by using any of the following commands:$ kill  -9  $$               // $$ stores the PID of current shell$ kill  -s  KILL 0          // kills all processes including the login shell "
Question 530,"9. Kill -l will list all the signal numbers on our machine.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: To view the list of all signal names and numbers that are available on our machine, we have to use the -l option with kill command or view the file /usr/include/sys/signal.h "
Question 531,1. What is a job?,a) group of tasks,b) group of commands,c) group of processes,d) group of signals,c,"Explanation: A job is a name given to a group of processes. The easiest way of creating a job is to run a pipeline of two or more commands. If we are using C, Korn or Bash shell we can use the job control commands to manipulate jobs."
Question 532,2. Which of the following command is used to suspend a job?,a) ctrl-Z,b) ctrl-Q,c) bg,d) $,a,"Explanation: Suppose we invoke a command and the prompt hasn’t returned even after a long time then we can suspend that job by pressing Ctrl-Z. The point needed to be focused here is, the job hasn’t terminated yet; it’s only suspended or stopped."
Question 533,3. Which command will push the current foreground job to the background?,a) bg,b) fg,c) ctrl-Z,d) kill,a,"Explanation: If we’d suspended a job using ctrl-Z then after that we can use the bg command to push the current foreground job to the background. For example,$ bg[1]     sort  abd.index  >  mash.index &   // this job has been sent to the background. [1] // indicates job number 1."
Question 534,4. ____ command will bring the background jobs to the foreground.,a) bg,b) fg,c) ctrl-Z,d) kill,b,"Explanation: We can use the fg command to bring any of the background jobs to the foreground. To bring the most recent background job to the foreground we can use the following command:$ fg"
Question 535,"5. The command fg %1 will bring the first background job to the foreground.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: fg command can be used with the job number, job name or a string as arguments prefixed with the % symbol. For example,$ fg  %3            // brings the third job to foreground "
Question 537,"6. The command bg %2 is valid.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: bg command can also be used with the job number, job name or a string as arguments prefixed with the % symbol. For example, if we’ve suspended two jobs but now we want  to send the second job to the background, use the following command:$ bg  %2"
Question 538,7. What does the following command do?,a) kills job number 2,b) kills the second background job,c) invalid command,d) kill all foreground & background jobs,b,"Explanation: We can use the identifiers like job number, job name or a string of arguments with kill command to terminate a job. Thus kill %2 will kill the second background job."
Question 539,8. Which of the following is not a part of job control facilities?,a) relate a job to the background,b) bring it back to the foreground,c) kill a job,d) create a new job,d,"Explanation: If we are using the C, Korn or Bash shell then we can use their job control facilities to manipulate jobs. Job control in these shells means that we can :•    Relate a job to the background (bg)•    bring it back to the foreground (fg)•    kill a job (kill)•    list the active jobs (jobs)•    suspend a foreground job (ctrl-Z) "
Question 540,"9. POSIX shell provides job control facilities like bg or fg.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: If we are using the C, Korn or Bash shell then we can use their job control facilities to manipulate jobs like killing a job, pushing to background or foreground, suspending a foreground job. We cannot use these job control commands in any other shell except the above mentioned. "
Question 541,10. Which command is used to list the status of jobs?,a) fg,b) JOBS,c) jobs,d) fg,c,"Explanation: We can use the jobs command to list the status of the jobs. This command tells the state of the job along with job number. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('Sanfoundry_300x250_320x50_BTF_1'); });	$ jobs[3] Running wc -l fitr?? > word_count  &[2]    Running    sort  abd.index  >  mash.index &"
Question 542,11. We can schedule a job to run at a specified time of day using _______ command.,a) batch,b) at,c) cron,d) jobs,b,"Explanation: UNIX provides sophisticated facilities to schedule a job to run at a specified time of day using at command. at command takes as its arguments the time the job is to be executed and displays the > prompt. The input then has to be supplied from standard input. For example,$ at  19:07at> file02.sh[Ctrl-D] Commands will be executed using usr/bin/bash Job 1016171818.a  at Sun Jan 15  19:07:00  2018In the above command the script file named file02.sh goes to the queue and it will be executed at the specified time."
Question 543,12. We can use the _____ symbol with at command to redirect our output to a specified file.,a) >,b) <,c) >>,d) %,a,"Explanation: The standard output and standard error of the program scheduled using at command are mailed to the user who can use any mail reading program to view it. Alternatively, we can use the > symbol to redirect our output to a specified file for viewing it later. For example,$ at  19:07 file02.sh >  file02.txt        // output will be recorded in file02.txt"
Question 544,13. Which of the following keyword is not supported by at command?,a) now,b) noon,c) tomorrow,d) evening,d,"Explanation: at command offer keywords like now, noon, midnight, today, tomorrow to schedule jobs according to our convenience. We can also use the + operator with at command.  The words that can be used with + operator include hours, days, month, years, weeks."
Question 545,14. Which one of the following forms used with at command is invalid?,a) at noon,b) at now +2 years,c) at  3:07 + 1 day,d) at morning,d,"Explanation: at command offer keywords like now, noon, midnight, today, tomorrow to schedule jobs according to our convenience. For example,at noon               // at 12:00 hours todayat now + 2 years      // at current time after 2 yearsat  3:07 + 1 da       // at 3:07pm tomorrowat 15                 // 24 hrs format assumed"
Question 546,1. We can list the jobs queued using at command by using ____ option.,a) -p,b) -v,c) -l,d) -r,c,"Explanation: Jobs scheduled using at command are sent to a queue for later execution. To list the jobs in this queue we can use the -l option with at command. This command will list each of the scheduled jobs in the queue in this format.	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist1'); });	1        Thur  Jan 17  12:08:00 2018-01-20"
Question 547,"2. To remove a job from the queue, which option is used with at command?",a) -r,b) -l,c) -e,d) -t,a,"Explanation: Jobs can be listed using -l option with at command and can be removed using -r option. All we have to do is to provide the job number (of the job which we want to remove from the queue) as an argument to at command along with -r option. For example,$ at  -r  1        // removes job 1 from the queue."
Question 548,"3. We cannot find out the name of the program scheduled using at command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Unfortunately, the major drawback in at command is that we cannot find out the name of the program scheduled to be executed. This may create a problem when we are unable to recall whether a specific job has actually been scheduled for later execution."
Question 549,"4. Which command permits to schedule jobs for later execution, as soon as the system load permits?",a) at,b) %,c) batch,d) cron,c,"Explanation: The batch command also allows us to schedule jobs for later execution but unlike at command, it executes the jobs as soon as the system load permits. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ batch &lt;  emp.shCommands will be executed using usr/bin/bashJob 1016171818.a  at Sun Jan 15  16:07:00  2018This command doesn’t take any arguments but uses an internal algorithm to determine the execution time."
Question 550,"Commands will be executed using usr/bin/bashJob 1016171818.a  at Sun Jan 15  16:07:00  2018This command doesn’t take any arguments but uses an internal algorithm to determine the execution time.",,,,,,
Question 551,"5. Jobs scheduled using batch command goes to a special at queue.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: The batch command also allows us to schedule jobs for later execution but unlike at command, it executes the jobs as soon as the system load permits. Any job scheduled using batch goes to a special at queue."
Question 552,6. Jobs scheduled using batch command can be removed using ___ option.,a) -a,b) -d,c) -f,d) -r,d,"Explanation: Any job scheduled using batch goes to a special at queue. To remove a job from this queue we can use the -r option with at command. For example,$ at  -r  1        // removes job 1 from the queue."
Question 553,7. What is a daemon?,a) process whose parent has died,b) process who has completed its execution but still has an entry in the process table,c) process which is running infinitely,d) process which runs automatically without any user interaction.,d,"Explanation: Daemons are processes which run automatically without requiring any user interaction. These are designed to help the user by performing tasks which are commonly done. For example, checking for an e-mail."
Question 554,8. What is cron?,a) a simple process,b) an orphan process,c) a daemon,d) a zombie process,c,"Explanation: cron is a daemon which runs on UNIX systems. It executes programs at regular intervals. It lets us to schedule jobs so that they can be scheduled repeatedly. It executes cron jobs created by the crontab. For example, a cron job can be scheduled for processing logs every evening."
Question 555,"9. The cron tab is a table having a list of commands that are scheduled to be run at regular intervals.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: The cron-tab or cron table is a list of commands that are scheduled to be run at regular intervals. The crontab command opens the crontab for scheduling, editing, removing, modify scheduled tasks."
Question 556,10. Which of the following command will remove the current crontab?,a) crontab -p,b) crontab -l,c) crontab -e,d) crontab -r,d,Explanation: We can see the contents of our crontab file using crontab -l command and can remove them with crontab -r. We can also enter cron commands using crontab -e command. 
Question 557,"11. To find out how efficiently a program a used the system resources, which command is used?",a) sys,b) time,c) crontab,d) daemon,b,"Explanation: When there are multiple versions of a program and we want to find out how efficiently they’ve used the system resources we can use the time command. The time command accepts the entire command line to be timed as its argument. It executes the command and also displays the time usage on the terminal. For example,$ time sort -o  emp.txt  invoi.txtreal    0m19.811s    // time elapsed from the invocation of command until its terminationuser    0m1.851s    // time spent in executing itselfsys    0m9.761s    // time spent by the kernel in doing work on behalf of the user process"
Question 558,1. The UNIX shell is both _______ and _______ language.,"a) interactive, responsive","b) interpreter, executing","c) scripting, interpreter","d) high level, low level",c,"Explanation: The UNIX shell is both an interpreter and scripting language. We can also say that shell can be interactive or non-interactive. When we log in to our system, interactive shell presents a prompt and wait for our requests while a non-interactive shell is managed by an interactive shell while executing a shell script."
Question 559,2. Which of the following function(s) are performed by an interactive shell?,a) job control,b) history,c) aliases,"d) job control, history, aliases",d,"Explanation: When we log in to our system, an interactive shell presents a prompt and waits for our requests. This type of shell supports functions like job control, history, aliases etc."
Question 560,"3. Every feature used in an interactive shell can also be used by a shell script.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,Explanation: An interactive shell runs a non-interactive shell while executing a shell script. Every feature used in a shell script can also be used in an interactive shell but the reverse is not true. Job control and history have no meaning in a shell script.
Question 561,4. Which one of the following is arguably the best shell to use?,a) Bash,b) Korn,c) C,d) Bourne,a,Explanation: Bash was developed by GNU as a bourne again shell. It was a grand superset in that that contains the features of both C and Korn shells. Bash was developed to ultimately conform to the POSIX shell specification and is arguably the best shell to use.
Question 562,5. Which one of the following command is used to create a child shell?,a) fork,b) wait,c) sh,d) env,c,"Explanation: To create a child shell we can use the sh command. sh is basically the command name of Bourne shell. sh is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from a command line string. To create a child shell, simply invoke sh command without any argument."
Question 563,6. Shell variables are of ____ types.,a) 1,b) 3,c) 2,d) 4,c,"Explanation: Shell variables are of two types –local and environment. For example, PATH, HOME and SHELL are environment variables. They are called so because they are available in the user’s total environment whereas local variables are more restricted in scope."
Question 564,"7. Suppose ABD_DIR is a local variable. Then it will be accessible to the child process.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: Since ABD_DIR is a local variable and local variables are more restricted to the scope so it will not be accessible to the child process. For example,$ ABD_DIR=/home/users/abd/doc       // local variable in parent process$echo ABD_DIRhome/users/abd/doc$ sh                              // create a child shell$echo ABD_DIR_                                // variable not available in child shell"
Question 565,8. ____ command is used to display the environment variables only.,a) set,b) env,c) sh,d) var,b,"Explanation: env command is used to display environment variables only in the current shell. For example, invocation of env command will produce an output in the following form:$ envHOME=/home/abdLOGNAME=abdMAIL=/var/mail/kumarSHELL=/usr/bin/bashTERM=xterm"
Question 566,9. ____ command displays all the variables available in the current shell.,a) env,b) set,c) var,d) sh,b,"Explanation: set command is used to display all the variables available in the current shell. set is a built-in command. env is an external command and runs in a child process. It thus displays only those variables that are inherited from its parent, the shell."
Question 567,"10. Environment variable names can be defined only in uppercase.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,Explanation: We’ve seen that environment variables are generally defined in uppercase only. But there is nothing which can prevent us from using a different scheme.
Question 568,"11. Environment variables control the behaviour of the system.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Environment variables control the behaviour of the system. They determine the environment in which we work. If they are not set properly, we may not be able to use some of the commands without a pathname."
Question 569,12. The shell has ____ prompts.,a) 1,b) 4,c) many,d) 2,d,Explanation: The shell has two prompts (PS1 and PS2). The primary prompt string PS1 is the one we normally see i.e. ($). The > is the secondary prompt stored in PS2 which is used by the shell while responding to a multiline command.
Question 570,13. Which one of the following command will change our primary prompt from $ to C>  ?,a) PS1=”C> “,b) PS2=”C>”,c) PS1=”>C”,d) PS2=”<C”,a,"Explanation: The primary prompt string PS1 is the one we normally see i.e. $. But we can change this prompt for our convenience. As we know that primary prompt string is stored in PS1, we can use the following command to change our prompt.$ PS1=”C&gt;”C&gt;        // new prompt"
Question 571,14. Which environment variable is used to display our username?,a) PATH,b) MAIL,c) LOGNAME,d) HOME,c,"Explanation: LOGNAME is an environment variable which can be used with echo command as an argument to display our username. We can also know our username using who am i command. For example,$ echo $LOGNAME    Abd                // username"
Question 572,15. Which one of the following is not an environment variable?,a) HOME,b) PATH,c) USER,d) env,d,"Explanation: env is an external command which runs in a child process and it lists only environment variables which are inherited from its parent, the shell.VARIABLES    SIGNIFICANCEHOME-         home directory, the directory where a user is placed on logging inUSER-         login name of userPATH-         list of directories searched by shell to locate the command"
Question 573,1. Which symbol is used for setting the PS1 prompt to show the current event number?,a) ^,b) !,c) &,d) |,b,"Explanation: Bash and Korn shell also supports history facility that treats a previous command as an event and associates it with a number. Thus we can recall and execute previous commands by their event numbers. Using the !, we can set the PS1 prompt to show the current event number. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist1'); });	$ PS1=’ [!] ’        //bash requires \ before ![42] _              // number associated Every time a command is executed, the event number is incremented."
Question 574,2. Which escape sequence is used with PS1 to show the hostname of our computer?,a) \n,b) \c,c) \h,d) \e,c,"Explanation: Bash uses a number of escape sequences to make our prompt as much informative as possible. For example, the \h string will show the hostname of our computer.$ PS1=”\h ”Saturn> _        //Saturn is the machine’s name"
Question 575,3. Which of the following shells support the use of aliases?,a) bourne,b) Korn,c) bash,d) Korn and bash,d,"Explanation: Bash and Korn shell supports the use of aliases which lets us assign shorthand names to frequently used commands. For example,$ alias  a1=’ls  -l’    // quoting necessary for multiple words$ a1                   // a1 will now execute the ls  -l command"
Question 576,"4. We can display an alias definition by using an alias with the name.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Aliases lets us assign shorthand names to frequently used commands. We can display an alias definition using an alias with the name. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ alias  a1a1=’ls  -l’"
Question 577,5. Which command is used in bash and Korn shells to display the previously used commands?,a) his,b) history,c) sh,d) ps,b,Explanation: Bash and Korn support a versatile history feature that treats a previous command as an event and associates it with an event number. The history command displays the history list showing the event number of every previously executed command.
Question 578,"6. To display the last five used commands, which one of the following commands is used (in bash shell)?",a) history  5,b) history -5,c) history,d) history  5-,a,"Explanation: While bash displays the complete history list using history command. Korn lists the 16 commands recently used. But we can easily find out the last five commands by using a numeric argument:$ history  5        // in bash$ history -5        // in Korn"
Question 579,7. Which of the following symbols are used for accessing previous commands by event numbers?,a) !,b) r,c) $,d) ! and r,d,"Explanation: The ! symbol (r in Korn) is used to repeat previous commands. For repeating the last command we have to use !! in bash and r in Korn. We can repeat other commands also, but with the event number as an argument. For example, following commands will repeat the command with event number 38,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('Sanfoundry_300x250_320x50_BTF_1'); });	$ !38      // in bash $ r 38     // in Korn"
Question 580,"8. We can use relative addressing while executing previous commands.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Suppose if we don’t know the event number and we want to execute the command prior to the previous one, we can use relative addressing by using a negative argument with ! or r. For example,$ !-2         //in bash$ r -2        //in Korn"
Question 581,"9. We can also execute previous commands by context.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: It may happen that we don’t remember the event numbers of the commands except for the immediately preceding two or three, but we remember that the command started with a specific letter or string. In such a case, we can execute previous commands by context by using ‘v’ along with ! or r. For example,$ !v        // repeat last command beginning with v (in bash)$ rv        // repeats last command beginning with v (in Korn) "
Question 583,10. Which symbol is used as a shorthand for using the last argument to the previous command?,a) %,b) _,c) |,d) $,d,"Explanation: Sometimes we run several commands on the same file and instead of specifying the filename, again and again, we can use $ as a shorthand. This expression signifies the last argument to the previous command. For example,$ mkdir prog_one       // create a directory $ cd $                 // change directory to mkdir "
Question 585,"1. set command by default displays the variables in the current shell.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: The set statement by default displays the variables in the current shell, but in bash and Korn shell, it can make several environment settings with -o option."
Question 586,2. Which one of the following keyword is used with the set command to avoid overwrite existing file?,a) nooverwrite,b) ignore,c) clobber,d) noclobber,d,"Explanation:  The shell’s > symbol overwrites (clobber) an existing file, and to prevent such accidental overwriting, e have to use noclobber argument in the following way:$ set  -o  noclobber        // no more overwriting file with &gt; "
Question 588,"3. To prevent accident logging out, we can use ____ as a keyword with the set command.",a) noclobber,b) log out,c) ignoreeof,d) ignore,c,"Explanation: It may happen that sometimes when we press the Ctrl-d with intent to terminate standard input, but end up logging out of the system. The ignoreeof keyword offers protection from accidental logging out.$ set  -o  ignoreeof        //no more logging out using ctrl-d"
Question 589,4. To reverse any setting updated by set command we can use ____ symbol.,a) –,b) /,c) +,d) $,c,"Explanation: A set option is turned off with set +o keyword. For example, to reverse the noclobber feature use the following command:	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('SanFoundry_300x250_320x50_320x100_inlist2'); });	$ set +o noclobber."
Question 590,5. The ____ acts as a shorthand representation of the home directory.,a) $,b) ~,c) “”,d) %,b,"Explanation: The ~ acts as a shorthand representation of the home directory. When the ~ (tidle) is followed by a login name, the shell understands the entire argument as the absolute pathname of the login directory. Thus when the shell encounters the following command line, it switches the Sharma’s home directory.$ cd ~ sharma         //effectively becomes $HOME/sharma"
Question 591,"6. Every shell uses at least one startup script in the user’s home directory, which is executed when the user logs in.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Every shell uses at least one startup script in the user’s home directory. This script is executed when the user logs in. Some shells also make use of a separate file that is run before logging out. We can look for these files in our home directory..profile (Bourne shell).profile and .kshrc (Korn shell).bash_profile or .bashrc (bash shell)"
Question 592,7. Which file is executed every time a second shell is called up?,a) .profile,b) rc file,c) .script,d) env.file,b,"Explanation: There is no rc file in Bourne, but bash and Korn shell use one. This file is defined by an environment variable (BASH_ENV in bash and ENV in Korn). This rc file is executed every time a second shell is called up (when running a shell script, for instance)."
Question 593,8. Which of the following are history variables?,a) HISTISIZE,b) HISTFILESIZE,c) HISTORY,d) HISTISIZE and HISTFILESIZE,d,"Explanation: The history list is maintained in memory. Bash uses two separate variables HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE for setting the size of the history list in memory and on disk. For example,$ HISTSIZE=500                      // bash and Korn$ HISTFILESIZE=1000                // bash only -determines the size of disk file"
Question 594,9. Which one of the following command will search history list for previous command having the last occurrence of string cvf?,a) /cvf,b) /cvf [enter] ,c) /bkw,d) !cvf,a,"Explanation: We can also use vi’s search technique to recall previous commands from the history list. Even we can also search in the reverse direction, using /pattern sequence."
Question 595,1. Every file system has a directory structure headed by ____,a) parent,b) child,c) root,d) kernel,c,Explanation: Every file system comprises of a file hierarchy which consists of files and directories held together. Every file system has a directory structure headed by root. 
Question 596,"2. Every file is associated with a table which contains all possible information about a file, that table is called as _________",a) info table,b) file table,c) inode,d) ps table,c,Explanation: Every file is associated with a table that contains all the necessary possible information we need to know about a file. This table is called the inode ( shorthand from index node) and this table is accessible using an inode number.
Question 597,3. Which of the following is not a content of inode?,a) file type,b) file permission,c) file size and links,d) file name,d,"Explanation: Every file is associated with a table that contains all the necessary possible information we need to know about a file. This table contains the following attributes of a file:•    file type•    file permissions•    an array of pointers that keeps track of all disk blocks used by the file•    file size and links•    The UID of owner and GID of group owner•    Date and time of:o    Last accesso    Last modificationo    Last change of inode"
Question 598,4. Which of the following is not stored in inode?,a) file name,b) inode number,c) file size,d) file name and inode number,d,Explanation: Neither the name of the file nor the inode number associated with it is stored in the inode. It is the directory which stores the inode number along with the filename.
Question 599,5. Which option is used with ls command for knowing the inode number of the file?,a) -l,b) -i,c) -a,d) -o,b,"Explanation: The ls command reads the inode to fetch a file’s attributes. One option i.e. -i tells us the inode number of a file. For example,$ ls  -il  abd.txt9059  -rw-r--r--    1  kumar   metallone   52626  Jan 21  11:54  abd.txt "
Question 601,"6. Two files can have a same inode number in the same file system.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,b,"Explanation: No two files in the same file system can have the same inode number unless one of the file is removed. When that happens, the kernel will allocate this inode number to a new file."
Question 602,"7. When we can access a file with multiple filenames, it is said that the file has multiple _____",a) names,b) inode number,c) links,d) uid,c,"Explanation: A filename is not stored in the inode because a file can have multiple filenames. When this happens, we say that the file has more than one link, which means that we can access this file using multiple filenames. The number of links associated with a file can be viewed using ls command."
Question 603,8. Which command is used to link a file with multiple filenames?,a) ln,b) link,c) hl,d) sl,a,"Explanation: A file is linked with the ln (link) command, which takes two filenames as arguments. The command can create both hard and soft links. The syntax for creating a hard link is as follows:$ ln original_filename  link_name    $ ln  emp.lst  employee        //employee must not exist "
Question 605,9. Which option is used with ln command to create a soft link?,a) -a,b) -l,c) -s,d) -e,c,"Explanation: We can also create soft links using ln command. All we have to do is to use -s option along with ln command. For example,$ ln  -s  original_filename  link_name$ ln  -s emp.lst  employee "
Question 607,"10. A hard-linked file is assigned the same inode number as the original value.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Each hard linked file is assigned the same inode number as the original one, hence they refer to the same physical location. Hard links are more flexible as compared to soft links, as they remain linked even after the original file is removed."
Question 608,"11. If we want to link files across the file systems, we have to use only soft links.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: A symbolic link or soft link is same as a shortcut feature in Windows OS. Each soft linked file contains a separate inode number which points to the original file. Soft links are used when we want to link files across the file systems. Soft Link contains the path for original file and not the contents of the file. 
Question 609,12.  The default permissions for a regular file are ____ and for directories are ____,"a) 777, 666","b) 666, 777","c) 000, 000","d) 777, 777",b,"Explanation: When we create a file or a directory, the permissions assigned to them depend on the system’s default settings. The default permissions for regular files in UNIX system are 666 (in octal) or rw-rw-rw- and for directories are 777 (in octal) or rwxrwxrwx."
Question 610,13. We can change the default permission set for files and directories using ______,a) umask,b) um,c) perm,d) touch,a,"Explanation: The permissions of a file/ directory are managed at the time when we create these. The permissions are transformed by subtracting the user mask from it to remove one or more permissions. For example,$ umask022This is an octal number which is subtracted from the system default to obtain the actual default. Hence it will become 644 for ordinary files and 755 for directories. Now if we create any file or directory, the permissions associated will be 644 and 755 respectively. "
Question 611,"This is an octal number which is subtracted from the system default to obtain the actual default. Hence it will become 644 for ordinary files and 755 for directories. Now if we create any file or directory, the permissions associated will be 644 and 755 respectively. ",,,,,,
Question 612,14. Which command is used to change timestamps associated with a file?,a) touch,b) time,c) umask,d) ls,a,"Explanation: A UNIX file has three time stamps associated with it which are:1. time of last file modification2. time of last access3. time of last inode modificationThese timestamps are changed using the touch command. "
Question 613,"15. When touch command is used without any options or expression, both times are set to current time and the file is created if it doesn’t exist.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: When we use the touch command without any options or expression, both modification and access times are set to the current time. The file specified is created if it doesn’t exist. For example,$ touch emp.txt "
Question 615,16. Which option is used with touch command to change the time of last file modification?,a) -a,b) -m,c) -r,d) -i,b,"Explanation: Touch command when used with -m option and an expression will change the modification time of the file. For example,$ touch -m 02281030  emp.txt ; ls  -l emp.txtrw-rw-rw  1  abd  metal  870 Feb  28  10:30  emp.txt"
Question 616,"17. -a option is used with touch command to alter the time of last access.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Touch command when used with -a option and an expression will change the last access time of the file. For example,$ touch -a 01261650  emp.txt ; ls  -l emp.txtrw-rw-rw  1  abd  metal  870 Jan  26  16:50  emp.txt"
Question 617,"18. When touch command is used without any option but with an expression, which of the following timestamps are changed?",a) modification time,b) last access time,c) last inode modification,d) modification time and last access time,d,"Explanation: When touch command is used without options but with an expression, it changes both access and modification times. The expression is an eight number using the format MMDDhhmm (month, day, hour and minute). For example,$ touch 03161430  emp.txt ; ls -l emp.txtrw-rw-rw-  1  kumar  metal  870 Mar 16 14:30  emp.txt"
Question 618,1. Which command is used for locating files?,a) search,b) find,c) loc,d) type,b,Explanation: find is one of the most powerful tools of the UNIX system. It recursively examines a directory tree to look for file matching based on some criteria and then takes some action on the selected files.
Question 619,2. The syntax of the find command is ____________,a) find  path_list  selection_criteria  action,b) find action path_list  selection_criteria,c) find  selection_criteria  action  path,d) find path  action,a,"Explanation: find command has a very difficult command line, however, find is easily tamed if we break up its arguments into three components. The syntax for using find command is,$ find  path_list  selection_criteria  action "
Question 621,3. Which symbol is used with find command for specifying arguments?,a) +,b) –,c) + and –,d) |,c,"Explanation: find command searches for a given file according to the arguments specified in the command line. Each argument is preceded by a – (hyphen). For example, to display all files in the current directory having .c extension, use the following command:$ find .  -name “*.c” -print"
Question 622,4. What will be the output of the following command?,a) all files having filename as a.out,b) all files in the root directory,c) undefined output,d) erroneous,a,Explanation: The path list (/) indicates that the search will begin from the root directory. Each file in the list is then matched against the selection criteria (a.out). The third section -print is the action taken on the files; i.e. t display matched files on the terminal.
Question 623,"5. We can use relative pathname in the path list while using find command.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: find command allows us to specify the relative pathname in the path list. For example, the following command will display all the .txt files in the current directory.$ find .  -name “*.txt” -print        // single quotes can also work"
Question 624,6. Which one of the following option is used for locating the files by inode number?,a) -name,b) -inum,c) -inode,d) -ind,b,"Explanation: find command allows us to locate files by their inode number. To do so, we’ve to use the -inum option to find all the filenames having the same inode number. For example,$ find  /  -inum  13857  -print        // display all the files linked (having same inode number) "
Question 626,7. Which option is used with find command for specifying the file type?,a) -perm,b) -inum,c) -name,d) -type,d,"Explanation: The -type option followed by letter f, d, or l selects files of the ordinary, directory and symbolic link type. For example,$ find .  -type d  -print        // display all the directory files in the current directory "
Question 628,8. To specify permissions while using find command we have to use _____ option.,a) -perm,b) -inum,c) -name,d) -type,a,"Explanation: The -perm option specifies the permissions to match. For example, -perm 666 selects those files which are having read and write permissions for all categories of users. For example,$ find $HOME  -perm 666 -type d  -print        // select directories in the home directory having                                                                 666 (in octal) permissions."
Question 629,9. Which option is used with find command to search for files based on access time?,a) -atime,b) -mtime,c) -time,d) -type,a,"Explanation: find command offers an option which can be used to select files based on access time. For this purpose, we have to use -atime option with the find command. For example,$ find . -atime -2  -print              //display those files which have been last accessed in less than 2 days"
Question 630,10. Which of the following command will be used to locate those files that have not been modified for more than a year?,a) find .  -mtime 1,b) find  . -mtime 1 year -print,c) find . -mtime  +365 -print,d) find . -mtime -365 -print,c,"Explanation: To select files those file that have not been modified for more than a year, a positive value has to be used with -mtime. Here +365 means more than 365 days whereas -365 is used for less than 365 days. "
Question 631,11. Which of the following operator is used with find command for performing the negate function?,a) -a,b) -o,c) &&,d) !,d,"Explanation: There are three operators that are commonly used with the find command. The ! operator is used before an option to negate its meaning. For example,$ find . ! -name “*.c” -print        // select all files but not the C program files."
Question 632,12. Which operator is used to specify the AND condition in find command?,a) !,b) &&,c) -A,d) -a,d,"Explanation: The -a operator when used with find command represents the AND condition and is implied by default when two selection criteria are placed together.

Question 853,9. Which one of the following is an internal command?,a) cut,b) expr,c) set,d) Is,c,"Explanation: set statement is an internal command which assigns its arguments to positional parameters $1, $2 and so on. While cut, Is and expr are external commands. "
Question 854,10. Which symbol is used with the set command for command substitution?,a) –,b) —,c) ??,d) _,b,"Explanation: set statement can also be used for command substitution. There can be a problem especially when the output of the command begins with a – .It may happen that set interprets it as an option. To avoid this condition, we have to use — (double hyphen) immediately after set. For example,$ set -- `ls -lfile01`        //first - now taken care of"
Question 855,11. The ____ allows us to read data from the same file containing the script.,a) >>,b) <<,c) !!,d) —,b,"Explanation: It may happen that the data our program wants to read is fixed and limited. The shell uses << symbol to read data from the same file containing the script. This is referred to as a here document, signifying that the data is here rather than in a separate file. "
Question 856,"12. Any command using standard input can take the input from here document.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: The shell uses >> symbol to read data from the same file containing the script. This is referred to as a here document. It allows any command (which uses standard input) to take input from it. 
Question 857,13. Which of the following command doesn’t accept a filename as an argument?,a) cut,b) ls,c) paste,d) mailx,d,"Explanation: The mailx command doesn’t accept any filename as its argument. So if we want to give input to the mailx command, we can use the here document."
Question 858,"14. We can use the here document with interactive programs also.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: Many commands require input from the user. So we can use the here document with interactive programs also. In this manner, we can instruct any script to take the input non-interactively by supplying the input using the here document. For example,$ empone.sh <<END        //empone.sh is a script>manager>emp.lst            > ENDHence by using the above commands, we can search for the pattern ‘manager’ in emp.lst ."

Why?,a) location of the file changed,b) we can’t change the name of the script,c) $0 was used in the script,d) many possible reasons,c,Explanation: A shell script will stop running when we change its name if we’d used the positional parameter $0 in it as $0 contains the name of the script file.
Question 866,5. Where is the exit status of a command stored?,a) $0,b) $>,c) $1,d) $?,d,Explanation: The exit status of a command is that particular value which is returned by the command to its parent. This value is stored in $?. 
Question 867,6. Which of the following is false?,a) here document provides standard input to any script non interactively,b) read command is used for making scripts interactive,c) $* stores the number of arguments specified,d) && and || are logical operators,c,Explanation: The shell uses <<symbol to read data from the same file containing the script. This is referred to as a here document. read command allows us to take input from the user to make the script interactive. && and || are logical operators which allow conditional execution. $* stores the complete set of positional parameters as a single string.
Question 868,7. test statement cannot ______,a) compare two numbers,b) compare two strings,c) compare two files,d) check a file’s attributes,c,"Explanation: test works in three ways:•    compare two numbers•     compare two strings•    check a file’s attributes"
Question 869,8. ____ option is used with test for checking if the file exists and has the size greater than zero.,a) -f,b) -r,c) -e,d) -s,d,"Explanation: test can also be used for performing various file tests like checking whether the file is a regular file, or is it readable, writable or executable. To check whether the file exists and has the size greater than zero, we have to use -s option with test. For example,	advertisement	    freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('Sanfoundry_300x250_320x50_BTF_1'); });	$ test -s filename "
Question 871,"9. Every time shift command is used, the leftmost variable is lost.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,"Explanation: shift statement is used for shifting the positional parameters to its immediate lower ones.
