Question 101,An ant climbing up a vertical pole ascends 12 meters and slips down 5 meters in every alternate hour. If the pole is 63 meters high how long will it take it to reach the top?,18 hours,17 hours,16 hours 35 min,16 hours 40 min,C, Since it climbs 7 meter in every 2 hr. At the end of 14 hours it would have climbed up to 49 mt. In 15th hour it will reach 61 mt. Then drops back to 56 mt in the 16th hour. It will take another 35 min to travel remaining 7 mt since it will be ascending in the 17th hour. Thus 16 hr and 35 min.Detail Explanation:GivenAnt ascends 12 meters in first hours and slips down 5 meters in second hour. This is repeated in every alternate hour. (12 - 5 = 7 meters)Therefore in ends of 14 hoursAnt ascends = (14 *7)/2 = 49 meters.So In next hour i.e 15 hour Ant will ascends another 12 meter.Till end of 15th hour Ant climbed = 49 + 12 = 61 meters. But in 16th hour Ant will slips down 5 meters (61 - 5 = 56 meters).Remaining pole to climb63 - 56 = 7

Question 176,A complete 7/10 of a work in 15 days then he completed the remaining work with the help of B in 4 days. In how many day A and B can complete entire work together?,10(1/2) days,12(2/3) days,13(1/3) days,8(1/4) days,C,7/10 part of work has been completed by A in 15 days. ThenRest work = 1-(7/10) = 3/10 part.Given That 3/10 part of the work is completed by A and B together in 4 days. Means(A+B) completed the 3/10 of work in 4 days.So (A+B)'s 1 day's work = 3/(10*4) = 3/40;Hence(A+B) can complete the work in 40/3 = 13(1/3) days.
Question 177,A can complete a piece of work in 36 days B in 54 days and C in 72 days. All the three began the work the work together but A left 8 days before the completion of the work and B 12 days before the completion of work. Only C worked up to the end. In how many days was the work completed?,24,25,27,30,A, Let the work be completed in x days. C work for x days then A works for (x-8) days and B works for (x-12) days.According to the question[(x-8)/36 + (x-12)/54 + x/72] = 1;[(6x-48+4x-48+3x)/216] = 1;13x-96 = 216;13x = 216+96 = 312;x = 312/13 = 24 days.Alternatively We can solve it through percentage method:Let the work be completed in X days.

How much time would the two men and the women need to complete the task if they all asked together?,1 hour,2 hours,3 hours,4 hours,A, Difference in times required by the first man (A) and second man (B) = 3 hours. Also if ta and tb are the respective times thentb - ta = 3 . . . . . . . . . ..(1)Also B alone be take = (ta + 3) hAccording to the question2tb - ta = 82* (ta + 3) - ta = 8 [Using equation (1)]ta = 2 hours.Now B and woman together take 2 hours and A also take 2 hours so time required will be half when all 3 work together. So in 1 hour work would be completed.
Question 215,At a Tech Pvt Ltd. there are some engineering students employed as trainee engineers belong to two eminent institutions of India. One group belongs to IIT and another to NIT. Each student of IIT works for 10 hours a day till 60 days and each student of NIT works for 8 hours a day till 80 days on the two same project. The ratio of students of IIT and that of NIT is 4:5 respectively. Students of which institution is slower in work and by how much?,IITian is 20% less efficient,NITian is 33.33% less efficien,NIT is 25% less efficient,IIT is 33.33% less efficient,C, Let E1 and E2 are the working efficiency of each student of IIT and NIT per hour respectively.Using work equivalence method4 *10 *60 *E1 = 5 *8 *80 *E2E1 /E2 = 4/3As 3E1 = 4E% less efficient of NITians = (1 *100)/4 = 25%Thus each engineer from NIT is 25% efficient than that of IIT.
Question 216,42 women can do a piece of work in 18 days How many women would be required do the same work in 21 days.,35,36,37,38,B, Let X be the number of women required to finish the work in 21 days.Now using Work Equivalence Method:42 *18 = X * 21X = 36.Number of women required = 36.
Question 217,A is thrice good a workman as B and therefore is able to finish a job in 40 days less than B. Working together they can do it in:,15 days,16 days,18 days,20 days,A, GivenA is thrice good work man as B. MeansA = 3BLet B can finish work in X days then A will finish same work in (X-40) days alone.NowBX = 3B*(X-40)X = 60 days.B can finish work in 60 days then A can finish the work in 20 days.One day work of B = 1/60One day work of A = 1/20One day work of (A+B) = (1/60)+(1/20) = (1+3)/60 = 1/15.So they can finish work together in 15 days.
Question 218,A and B can compete a piece of work in 18 days. They worked together for 12 days and then A left. B alone finished the work in 15 days. If Rs. 1500 be paid for the work then A's share is:,Rs. 750,Rs. 800,Rs. 600,Rs. 900,C, A and B can complete the work in 18 days work rate = 100/18 = 5.55% per day.They together can complete the work in 12 days = 5.55 * 12 = 66.66%.Now A leaves and B takes another 15 days to complete the whole work Work rate of B = 33.33/15 = 2.22% per day.B work for (12+15) = 27 days.So Work done by B in 27 days = 2.22*27 = 60% And So 40% work is done by A. so there share should be 60% and 40% ratio.A's share = 40% of 1500 = Rs. 600.
Question 219,If 3 men or 4 women can plough a field in 43 days how long will 7 men and 5 women take to plough it?,10 days,11 days,9 days,12 days,D,3 men or 4 women can plough the field in 43 days.3 men = 4 women.1 man = 4/3 women.7 man = 28/3 women.7 men and 5 women = 5 + (28/3) = 43/3 women.4 women can plough field in 43 days.So1 women can plough in = 43 *4 days.Hence43/3 women can plough = (43*4 *3) /43 = 12 days.
Question 220,To complete a piece of work A and B take 8 days B and C 12 days. A B and C take 6 days. A and C will take :,7 Days,7.5 Days,8 Days,8.5 Days,C,Given (A+B)'s one day's work = 1/8(B+C)'s one day's work = 1/12(A+B+C) 's 1 day's work = 1/6Work done by A alone= (A+B+C) 's 1 day's work - (B+C)'s one day's work=(1/6) â€“(1/12) = (2âˆ’1)/12=1/12Work done by C alone = (A+B+C) 's 1 day's work - (A+B)'s one dayâ€™s work=(1/6)â€“(1/8) = (4âˆ’3)/24 = 1/24=> (A+C)â€™s one dayâ€™s work = (1/12) +(1/24) = (2+1)/24 = 3/24 = 1/8=> (A+C) will take 8 days to complete the work together.
Question 221,Two pipes can fill the cistern in 10hr and 12 hr respectively while the third empty it in 20hr. If all pipes are opened simultaneously then the cistern will be filled in:,7.5 hr,8 hr,8.5 hr,10 hr,A,Work done by all the tanks working together in 1 hour=> (1/10) + (1/12) âˆ’ (1/20) = 2/15.Hence tank will be filled in 15/2 = 7.5 hour.
Question 222,Three taps A B and C together can fill an empty cistern in 10 minutes. The tap A alone can fill it in 30 minutes and the tap B alone in 40 minutes. How long will the tap C alone take to fill it?,16 minutes,24 minutes,32 minutes,40 minutes,B,A B and C together can fill 100% empty tank in 10 minutes.Work rate of (A + B + C) = 100/10 = 10% per minute.A alone can fill the tank in 30 minutes.Work rate of A = 100/30 = 3.33% per minute.B alone can fill the tank in 40 minutes.Work rate of B = 100/40 = 2.5%.Work rate of (A +B) = 3.33 + 2.5 = 5.83% per minute.Work rate of C= Work rate of (A +B +c) - (A +B).= 10 - 5.83 = 4.17% per minute.So C takes = 100/4.17 = 24 minutes to fill the tank.
Question 223,A and B working separately can do a piece of work in 9 and 15 days respectively. If they work for a day alternately with A beginning then the work will be completed in:,9,10,11,12,C,Work rate of A = 100/9 = 11.11% work per day.Work rate of B = 100/15 = 6.66% work per day.They together can do (A +B) = 11.11 + 6.66 = 18% work per day.They are working in alternate day so we take 2 days = 1 unit of day.Therefore in one unit of day they can complete 18% of work.(A +B) can complete 90% of work in 5 units of days. i.e. (5 *18).And the rest 10% work will be completed by A in Next day.So total number of day= 5 Unit of days + 1 day of A= 2*5 + 1 = 11 days.
Question 224,Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in 36 min. and 45 min. respectively. Another pipe C can empty the tank in 30 min. First A and B are opened. After 7 minutes C is also opened. The tank filled up in:,39 min.,46 min,40 min.,45 min.,A, Pipe A can fill empty tank in 30 min.Pipe A can fill the tank = 100/36 = 2.77% per minute.Pipe B can fill empty tank in 45 min.Pipe B can fill the tank = 100/45 = 2.22% per min.A and B can together fill the tank= (2.77 + 2.22)= 5% per minute.So A and B can fill the tank in 7 min.= 7*5 = 35% of the tank.Rest tank to be filled = 100 - 35 = 65%.C can empty the full tank in 30 min.C can empty the tank = 100/30 = 3.33% per min.C is doing negative work i.e. emptying the tank.A B and C can together fill the tank= 2.77% + 2.22% - 3.33% = 1.67% tank per minute.So A B and C will take time to fill 65% empty tank= 65/1.67 = 39 min. (Approx.)
Question 225,Three men A B C working together can do a job in 6 hours less time than A alone in one hour less time than B alone and in one half the time needed by C when working alone. Then A and B together can do the job in:,2/3 hours,3/4 hours,3/2 hours,4/3 hours,D,Time taken by A =x hours.Therefore taken by AB and C together = (x-6)Time taken by B = (x-5).Time taken by C=2(x-5).Rate of work of A + Rate of work of B + Rate of work of C = Rate of work of ABC.[(1/x)+{1/(x-5)}+ {1/(2(x-6))}]= 1/(x-6);On Solving X =340/6.Taking x =3 hours.1/[(3/20)+(3/5)] = 4/3hours.
Question 226,A does half as much work as B in one -sixth of the time.If together they take 10 days to complete a work how much time shall B take to do it alone?,13.33 days,20 days,30 days,40 days,D,To do half of the work in one sixth of the time means A is 3 times as efficient as B. To understand this point just think if same work would have been done in one sixth of the time then A would have been six times as efficient as B.Now they together complete the work in 10 days. B is working with someone who is 3 times as efficient as himself. That means 4 people of B's efficiency finished the work in 10 days. So B alone would have done it in 40 days. A alone would have taken one third of this time.AlternativelyGivenA *1/6 = B *1/2So A = 3B.NowGiven they together complete the work in 10 days.So One Day''s work of(A +B) = 100/10 = 10%.(3B +B) = 10%.4B = 10%.So one day work of B = 10/4 = 2.5%.So B can comp
Question 227,An employee pays Rs. 26 for each day a worker and forfeits Rs. 7 for each day he idle. At the end of 56 days if the worker got Rs. 829 for how many days did the worker remain idle?,21,15,19,13,C,His Per day pay = Rs. 26.Total pay employee got = Rs. 829.Total pay he gets if he did not remain idle a single day= 26 *56 = Rs.1456.He Forfeits or fined = 1456 - 829 = Rs. 627.Per day he Forfeits Rs. 7. Means per idle day he looses = 26 +7 = Rs. 33.So Total idle days = 627/33 = 19 days.AlternativelyLet he works for X days and remain idle for (56 - X).Now According to questionX*26 - 7 *(56 -X)= 829.26X +7X - 392 = 829.33X = 829 + 392 = 1221.X = 37 days.No of days remain Idle = 56 -37 - 19 days.
Question 228,A is 60% more efficient than B. In how many days will A and B working together complete a piece of work which A alone takes 15 days to finish?,124/13,113/13,108/13,120/13,D,GivenA is 60% more efficient of B. MeansA = B + 60% of B.A = (8/5)B.A can complete whole work in 15 days SoOne day work of A = 1/15.One day work of 8B/5 = 1/15One day work of B = 5/(120) = 1/24.One day work (A + B)= (1/15) + (1/24)One day work (A +B) = (24 +15)/360 = 39/360. So Time taken to finish the work by A and B together = 360/39 = 120/13.AlternativelyWe can solve it through percentage method.GivenA = 8B/5A can complete whole work in 15 days.Work rate of A = 100/15 = 6.66% per day.Work rate of 8B/5 = 6.66%Work rate of B = 4.16% per day.Work rate of (A +B) = 6.66 + 4.16 = 10.82% per day.So A and B can complete 100% work
Question 229,A pipe can fill a tank in 0.9 hours and another pipe can empty in 0.7 hours. If tank is completely filled and both pipes are opened simultaneously then 450 liters of water is removed from the tank is 2.5 hours. What is the capacity of the tank?,200 liters,350 liters,456 liters,567 liters,D, Pipe A can fill the empty tank in = 0.9 hoursSo work rate of the Pipe A = 100/0.9 % per hour.Pipe B can empty the tank in = 0.7 hoursNegative Work rate of B = 100/0.7 % per hour. (B is removing water so taken as negative work.)Tank fill per hour = 100/0.7 - 100/0.9 = 31.75% per hour.Time Taken to empty the tank = 100/31.75 = 3.14 hours.So Capacity of the tank = 3.14 * 180 = 567 liters.
