Question 1,The ratio in which tea costing Rs. 192 per kg is to be mixed with tea costing Rs. 150 per kg so that the mixed tea when sold for Rs. 194.40 per kg gives a profit of 20%.,2:05,3:05,5:03,5:02,A, CP of first tea = Rs. 192 per kg.CP of Second tea = Rs. 150 per kg.Mixture is to be sold in Rs. 194.40 per kg which has included 20% profit. SoSP of Mixture = Rs. 194.40 per kg.Let the CP of Mixture be Rs. X per kg. ThereforeX + 20% of X = SP6X /5 = 194.406X = 194.40 *5X = Rs. 162 per kg.Let N kg of first tea and M kg of second tea to be added.Now Using AlligationWe getN/M = 12/30N : M = 2 : 5.,,,,,,,
Question 2,An alloy contains zinc copper and tin in the ratio 2:3:1 and another contains copper tin and lead in the ratio 5:4:3.

Question 60,A man travels equal distances of his journey at 40 30 and 15 km/h. respectively. Find his average speed for whole journey.,24,25,27,28,A, Required average speed= [(3*40*30*15)/{(40*30)+(40*15)+(30*15)}]= 24 km/hr. Alternatively Time taken to traveled 1/3 distance of journey with speed 40 kmph = (1/3)/40 = 1/120. Time taken to traveled 1/3 distance of journey with speed 30 kmph = (1/3)/30 = 1/90. Time taken to traveled 1/3 distance of journey with speed 15 kmph = (1/3)/15 = 1/45. Total time Taken = (1/120) + (1/90) + (1/45) = 45/1080.

Question 300,A boy appeared in CAT for four consecutive year years but coincidentally each time his net score was 75. He told me that there was 1/3rd negative marking for every wrong answer and 1 mark was allotted for every correct answer. He has attempted all the questions every year but certainly some answers have been wrong due conceptual problem. Which is not the total number of questions asked for CAT in any year in that period?,231,163,150,123,C, Option method:The best way to go through options. You will find that when you consider 150 questions you cannot get 75 marks anyhow.Alternatively:Since 75 is an integer he must have to do (75+4x) problems where x is a whole number. Now we put the value of x (0 123 4 5 .........) to get the correct answer.As he gets the net marks in integer it means when he does 3n question wrong he losses actually 4n marks.,,,,,,,
